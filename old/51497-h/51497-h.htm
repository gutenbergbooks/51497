<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p>Sometimes of a night, when the spirit
of a dream flits away for a waltz with the
shadow of a pen, over dreary moors and
dark waters, I behold an old man, with
a keen profile, under a parson’s shovel hat,
riding a tall chestnut horse up the western
slope of Exmoor, followed by his little
grandson upon a shaggy and stuggy pony.</p>

<p>In the hazy folds of lower hills, some four
or five miles behind them, may be seen the
ancient Parsonage, where the lawn is a
russet sponge of moss, and a stream tinkles
under the dining-room floor, and the pious
rook, poised on the pulpit of his nest, reads
a hoarse sermon to the chimney-pots below.
There is the home not of rooks alone, and
parson, and dogs that are scouring the
moor; but also of the patches of hurry we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
can see, and the bevies of bleating haste,
converging by force of men and dogs towards
the final <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rendezvous</i>, the autumnal
muster of the clans of wool.</p>

<p>For now the shrill piping of the northwest
wind, and the browning of furze and
heather, and a scollop of snow upon Oare-oak
Hill, announce that the roving of soft
green height, and the browsing of sunny
hollow, must be changed for the durance of
hurdled quads, and the monotonous munch
of turnips. The joy of a scurry from the
shadow of a cloud, the glory of a rally with
a hundred heads in line, the pleasure of
polishing a coign of rock, the bliss of beholding
flat nose, brown eyes, and fringy
forehead, approaching round a corner for a
sheepish talk, these and every other jollity
of freedom&mdash;what is now become of them?
Gone! Like a midsummer dream, or the
vision of a blue sky, pastured&mdash;to match the
green hill&mdash;with white forms floating peacefully;
a sky, where no dog can be, much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
less a man, only the fleeces of the gentle
flock of heaven. Lackadaisy, and well-a-day!
How many of you will be woolly ghosts like
them, before you are two months older!</p>

<p>My grandfather knows what fine mutton
is, though his grandson indites of it by
memory alone. “Ha, ha!” shouts the
happier age, amid the bleating turmoil, the
yelping of dogs, and the sprawling of shepherds;
“John Fry, put your eye on that
wether, the one with his J.&nbsp;B. upside down,
we’ll have a cut out of him on Sunday week,
please God. Why, you stupid fellow, you
don’t even know a B yet! That is Farmer
Passmore’s mark you have got hold of.
Two stomachs to a B; will you never understand?
Just look at what you’re doing!
Here come James Bowden’s and he has
got a lot of ours! <em>Shep</em> is getting stupid, and
deaf as a post. <em>Watch</em> is worth ten of him.
Good dog, good dog! You won’t let your
master be cheated. How many of ours,
John Fry? Quick now! You can tell, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
you can’t read; and I can read quicker than
I can tell.”</p>

<p>“Dree score, and vower Maister; ‘cardin’
to my rackonin’. Dree score and zax it
waz as us toorned out, zeventh of June, God
knows it waz. Wan us killed, long of
harvest-taime; and wan tummled into bog-hole,
across yanner to Mole’s Chimmers.”</p>

<p>“But,” says the little chap on the shaggy
pony, “John Fry, where are the four that
ought to have R.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;B. on them? You
promised me, on the blade of your knife,
before I went to school again, that my two
lambs should have their children marked
the same as they were.”</p>

<p>John turns redder than his own sheep’s-redding.
He knows that he has been caught
out in a thumping lie, and although that
happens to him almost every day, his
conscience has a pure complexion still.
“’Twaz along of the rains as wasshed ’un
out.” In vain has he scratched his head
for a finer lie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
“Grandfather, you know that I had two
lambs, and you let me put R.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;B. on
them with both my hands, after the
shearing-time last year, and I got six
shillings for their wool the next time, and I
gave it to a boy who thrashed a boy that
bullied me. And Aunt Mary Anne wrote
to tell me at school that my two lambs had
increased two each, all of them sheep; and
there was sure to be a lot of money soon for
me. And so I went and promised it right and
left, and how can I go back to school, and
be called a liar? You call this the <em>Telling-house</em>,
because people come here to tell their
own sheep from their neighbours’, when they
fetch them home again. But I should say
it was because they tell such stories here.
And if that is the reason, I know who can
tell the biggest ones.”</p>

<p>With the pride of a conscious author, he
blushes, that rogue of a John Fry blushes,
wherever he has shaved within the last three
weeks of his false life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x">x</a></span>
“Never mind, my boy; story-telling never
answers in the end,” says my Grandfather&mdash;oh
how could he thus foresee my fate? “Be
sure you always speak the truth.”</p>

<p>That advice have I followed always. And
if I lost my four sheep then, through the
plagiarism of that bad fellow, by hook or
crook I have fetched four more out of the
wilderness of the past; and I only wish they
were better mutton, for the pleasure of old
friends who like a simple English joint.</p>

<span class="subhead">AFTER A STORMY LIFE.</span></h3>

<p>To hear people talking about North
Devon, and the savage part called Exmoor,
you might almost think that there never
was any place in the world so beautiful, or
any living men so wonderful. It is not my
intention to make little of them, for they
would be the last to permit it; neither do I
feel ill will against them for the pangs they
allowed me to suffer; for I dare say they
could not help themselves, being so slow-blooded,
and hard to stir even by their own
egrimonies. But when I look back upon
the things that happened, and were for a
full generation of mankind accepted as the
will of God, I say, that the people who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
endured them must have been born to be
ruled by the devil. And in thinking thus I
am not alone; for the very best judges of
that day stopped short of that end of the
world, because the law would not go any
further. Nevertheless, every word is true
of what I am going to tell, and the stoutest
writer of history cannot make less of it by
denial.</p>

<p>My father was Sylvester Ford of Quantock,
in the county of Somerset, a gentleman
of large estate as well as ancient lineage.
Also of high courage and resolution
not to be beaten, as he proved in his many
rides with Prince Rupert, and woe that I
should say it! in his most sad death. To
this he was not looking forward much,
though turned of threescore years and five;
and his only child and loving daughter,
Sylvia, which is myself, had never dreamed
of losing him. For he was exceeding fond
of me, little as I deserved it, except by loving
him with all my heart and thinking nobody
like him. And he without anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
to go upon, except that he was my father,
held, as I have often heard, as good an
opinion of me.</p>

<p>Upon the triumph of that hard fanatic,
the Brewer, who came to a timely end by
the justice of high Heaven&mdash;my father,
being disgusted with England as well as
banished from her, and despoiled of all his
property, took service on the Continent,
and wandered there for many years, until
the replacement of the throne. Thereupon
he expected, as many others did, to get his
estates restored to him, and perhaps to be
held in high esteem at court, as he had a
right to be. But this did not so come to
pass. Excellent words were granted him,
and promise of tenfold restitution; on the
faith of which he returned to Paris, and
married a young Italian lady of good birth
and high qualities, but with nothing more
to come to her. Then, to his great disappointment,
he found himself left to live upon
air&mdash;which, however distinguished, is not
sufficient&mdash;and love, which, being fed so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
easily, expects all who lodge with it to
live upon itself.</p>

<p>My father was full of strong loyalty; and
the king (in his value of that sentiment)
showed faith that it would support him.
His majesty took both my father’s hands,
having learned that hearty style in France,
and welcomed him with most gracious
warmth, and promised him more than he
could desire. But time went on, and the
bright words faded, like a rose set bravely
in a noble vase, without any nurture under
it.</p>

<p>Another man had been long established
in our hereditaments by the Commonwealth;
and he would not quit them of his
own accord, having a sense of obligation to
himself. Nevertheless, he went so far as
to offer my father a share of the land, if
some honest lawyers, whom he quoted,
could find proper means for arranging it.
But my father said: “If I cannot have my
rights, I will have my wrongs. No mixture
of the two for me.” And so, for the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
few years of his life, being now very poor
and a widower, he took refuge in an outlandish
place, a house and small property in
the heart of Exmoor, which had come to the
Fords on the spindle side, and had been
overlooked when their patrimony was confiscated
by the Brewer. Of him I would
speak with no contempt, because he was
ever as good as his word.</p>

<p>In the course of time, we had grown used
to live according to our fortunes. And I
verily believe that we were quite content,
and repined but little at our lost importance.
For my father was a very simple-minded
man, who had seen so much of uproarious
life, and the falsehood of friends, and small
glitter of great folk, that he was glad to fall
back upon his own good will. Moreover he
had his books, and me; and as he always
spoke out his thoughts, he seldom grudged to
thank the Lord for having left both of these
to him. I felt a little jealous of his books
now and then, as a very poor scholar might
be; but reason is the proper guide for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
women, and we are quick enough in discerning
it, without having to borrow it from
books.</p>

<p>At any rate now we were living in a wood,
and trees were the only creatures near us,
to the best of our belief and wish. Few
might say in what part of the wood we
lived, unless they saw the smoke ascending
from our single chimney; so thick were
the trees, and the land they stood on so full
of sudden rise and fall. But a little river
called the Lynn makes a crooked border to
it, and being for its size as noisy a water as
any in the world perhaps, can be heard all
through the trees and leaves to the very top
of the Warren Wood. In the summer all
this was sweet and pleasant; but lonely and
dreary and shuddersome, when the twigs
bore drops instead of leaves, and the ground
would not stand to the foot, and the play of
light and shadow fell, like the lopping of a
tree, into one great lump.</p>

<p>Now there was a young man about this
time, and not so very distant from our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
place&mdash;as distances are counted there&mdash;who
managed to make himself acquainted with
us, although we lived so privately. To me
it was a marvel, both why and how he did
it; seeing what little we had to offer, and
how much we desired to live alone. But
Mrs. Pring told me to look in the glass, if I
wanted to know the reason; and while I
was blushing with anger at that, being only
just turned eighteen years, and thinking of
nobody but my father, she asked if I had
never heard the famous rhymes made by
the wise woman at Tarr-steps:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Three fair maids live upon Exymoor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rocks, and the woods, and the dairy-door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The son of a baron shall woo all three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But barren of them all shall the young man be.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Of the countless things I could never
understand, one of the very strangest was
how Deborah Pring, our only domestic,
living in the lonely depths of this great
wood, and seeming to see nobody but ourselves,
in spite of all that contrived to
know as much of the doings of the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
as if she went to market twice a
week. But my father cared little for any
such stuff; coming from a better part of the
world, and having been mixed with mighty
issues and making of great kingdoms, he
never said what he thought of these little
combings of petty pie crust, because it was
not worth his while. And yet he seemed
to take a kindly liking to the young De
Wichehalse; not as a youth of birth only,
but as one driven astray perhaps by harsh
and austere influence. For his father, the
baron, was a godly man,&mdash;which is much to
the credit of anyone, growing rarer and
rarer, as it does,&mdash;and there should be no
rasp against such men, if they would only
bear in mind that in their time they had
been young, and were not quite so perfect
then. But lo! I am writing as if I knew a
great deal more than I could know until
the harrow passed over me.</p>

<p>No one, however, need be surprised at
the favour this young man obtained with all
who came into his converse. Handsome,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
and beautiful as he was, so that bold maids
longed to kiss him, it was the sadness in his
eyes, and the gentle sense of doom therein,
together with a laughing scorn of it, that
made him come home to our nature, in a
way that it feels but cannot talk of. And
he seemed to be of the past somehow,
although so young and bright and brave;
of the time when greater things were done,
and men would die for women. That he
should woo three maids in vain, to me was
a stupid old woman’s tale.</p>

<p>“Sylvia,” my father said to me, when I
was not even thinking of him, “no more
converse must we hold with that son of the
Baron de Wichehalse. I have ordered Pring
to keep the door; and Mistress Pring, who
hath the stronger tongue, to come up if he
attempted to dispute; the while I go away
to catch our supper.”</p>

<p>He was bearing a fishing rod made by
himself, and a basket strapped over his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“But why, father? Why should such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
change be? How hath the young gentleman
displeased thee?” I put my face into
his beard as I spoke, that I might not
appear too curious.</p>

<p>“Is it so?” he answered, “then high
time is it. No more shall he enter this”&mdash;<em>house</em>
he would have said, but being so
truthful changed it into&mdash;“hut. I was
pleased with the youth. He is gentle and
kind; but weak&mdash;my dear child, remember
that. Why are we in this hut, my dear?
and thou, the heiress of the best land in
the world, now picking up sticks in the
wilderness? Because the man who should
do us right is weak, and wavering, and
careth but for pleasure. So is this young
Marwood de Wichehalse. He rideth with
the Doones. I knew it not, but now that
I know, it is enough.”</p>

<p>My father was of tall stature and fine
presence, and his beard shone like a
cascade of silver. It was not the manner
of the young as yet to argue with their
elders, and though I might have been a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
little fluttered by the comely gallant’s lofty
talk and gaze of daring melancholy, I said
good-bye to him in my heart, as I kissed
my noble father. Shall I ever cease to
thank the Lord that I proved myself a
good daughter then?</p>

<h3 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="subhead">BY A QUIET RIVER.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Living as we did all by ourselves, and
five or six miles away from the Robbers’
Valley, we had felt little fear of the Doones
hitherto, because we had nothing for them
to steal except a few books, the sight of
which would only make them swear and
ride away. But now that I was full-grown,
and beginning to be accounted comely, my
father was sometimes uneasy in his mind,
as he told Deborah, and she told me; for
the outlaws showed interest in such matters,
even to the extent of carrying off
young women who had won reputation thus.
Therefore he left Thomas Pring at home,
with the doors well-barred, and two duck
guns loaded, and ordered me not to quit
the house until he should return with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
creel of trout for supper. Only our little
boy Dick Hutchings was to go with him,
to help when his fly caught in the bushes.</p>

<p>My father set off in the highest spirits, as
anglers always seem to do, to balance the
state in which they shall return; and I knew
not, neither did anyone else, what a bold
stroke he was resolved upon. When it was
too late, we found out that, hearing so
much of that strange race, he desired to
know more about them, scorning the idea
that men of birth could ever behave like
savages, and forgetting that they had received
no chance of being tamed, as rough
spirits are by the lessons of the battlefield.
No gentleman would ever dream of attacking
an unarmed man, he thought; least of
all one whose hair was white. And so he
resolved to fish the brook which ran away
from their stronghold, believing that he
might see some of them, and hoping for a
peaceful interview.</p>

<p>We waited and waited for his pleasant
face, and long, deliberate step upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
steep, and cheerful shout for his Sylvia, to
come and ease down his basket, and say&mdash;“Well
done, father!” But the shadows of
the trees grew darker, and the song of the
gray-bird died out among them, and the
silent wings of the owl swept by, and all the
mysterious sounds of night in the depth of
forest loneliness, and the glimmer of a star
through the leaves here and there, to tell us
that there still was light in heaven&mdash;but of
an earthly father not a sign; only pain, and
long sighs, and deep sinking of the heart.</p>

<p>But why should I dwell upon this? All
women, being of a gentle and loving kind,&mdash;unless
they forego their nature,&mdash;know
better than I at this first trial knew, the
misery often sent to us. I could not
believe it, and went about in a dreary haze
of wonder, getting into dark places, when
all was dark, and expecting to be called out
again and asked what had made such a fool
of me. And so the long night went at last,
and no comfort came in the morning. But
I heard a great crying, sometime the next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
day, and ran back from the wood to learn
what it meant, for there I had been searching
up and down, not knowing whither I
went or why. And lo, it was little Dick
Hutchings at our door, and Deborah Pring
held him by the coat-flap, and was beating
him with one of my father’s sticks.</p>

<p>“I tell ’ee, they Doo-uns has done for
’un,” the boy was roaring betwixt his sobs;
“dree on ’em, dree on ’em, and he’ve a
killed one. The squire be layin’ as dead as
a sto-un.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pring smacked him on the mouth,
for she saw that I had heard it. What followed
I know not, for down I fell, and the
sense of life went from me.</p>

<p>There was little chance of finding Thomas
Pring, or any other man to help us, for
neighbours were none, and Thomas was gone
everywhere he could think of to look for
them. Was I likely to wait for night again,
and then talk for hours about it? I recovered
my strength when the sun went
low; and who was Deborah Pring, to stop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
me? She would have come, but I would
not have it; and the strength of my grief
took command of her.</p>

<p>Little Dick Hutchings whistled now, I
remember that he whistled, as he went
through the wood in front of me. Who
had given him the breeches on his legs and
the hat upon his shallow pate? And the
poor little coward had skiddered away, and
slept in a furze rick, till famine drove him
home. But now he was set up again by
gorging for an hour, and chattered as if he
had done a great thing.</p>

<p>There must have been miles of rough
walking through woods, and tangles, and
craggy and black boggy hollows, until we
arrived at a wide open space where two
streams ran into one another.</p>

<p>“Thic be Oare watter,” said the boy,
“and t’other over yonner be Badgery.
Squire be dead up there; plaise, Miss Sillie,
’ee can goo vorrard and vaind ’un.”</p>

<p>He would go no further; but I crossed
the brook, and followed the Badgery stream,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
without knowing, or caring to know, where
I was. The banks, and the bushes, and the
rushing water went by me until I came
upon&mdash;but though the Lord hath made us
to endure such things, he hath not compelled
us to enlarge upon them.</p>

<p>In the course of the night kind people
came, under the guidance of Thomas Pring,
and they made a pair of wattles such as
farmers use for sheep, and carried home
father and daughter, one sobbing and
groaning with a broken heart, and the other
that should never so much as sigh again.
Troubles have fallen upon me since, as the
will of the Lord is always; but none that I
ever felt like that, and for months everything
was the same to me.</p>

<p>But inasmuch as it has been said by
those who should know better, that my
father in some way provoked his merciless
end by those vile barbarians, I will put into
plainest form, without any other change,
except from outlandish words, the tale
received from Dick Hutchings, the boy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
who had seen and heard almost everything
while crouching in the water and huddled
up inside a bush.</p>

<p>“Squire had catched a tidy few, and he
seemed well pleased with himself, and then
we came to a sort of a hollow place where
one brook floweth into the other. Here he
was a-casting of his fly, most careful, for if
there was ever a trout on the feed, it was
like to be a big one, and lucky for me I was
keeping round the corner when a kingfisher
bird flew along like a string-bolt, and there
were three great men coming round a fuzz-bush,
and looking at squire, and he back to
them. Down goes I, you may say sure
enough, with all of me in the water but my
face, and that stuck into a wutts-clump,
and my teeth making holes in my naked
knees, because of the way they were
shaking.</p>

<p>“‘Ho, fellow!’ one of them called out to
squire, as if he was no better than father
is, ‘who give thee leave to fish in our
river?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
“‘Open moor,’ says squire, ‘and belongeth
to the king, if it belongeth to anybody.
Any of you gentlemen hold his
majesty’s warrant to forbid an old officer
of his?’</p>

<p>“That seemed to put them in a dreadful
rage, for to talk of a warrant was unpleasant
to them.</p>

<p>“‘Good fellow, thou mayest spin spider’s
webs, or jib up and down like a gnat,’ said
one, ‘but such tricks are not lawful upon
land of ours. Therefore render up thy
spoil.’</p>

<p>“Squire walked up from the pebbles at
that, and he stood before the three of them,
as tall as any of them. And he said,
‘You be young men, but I am old. Nevertheless,
I will not be robbed by three, or
by thirty of you. If you be cowards
enough, come on.’</p>

<p>“Two of them held off, and I heard them
say, ‘Let him alone, he is a brave old
cock.’ For you never seed anyone look
more braver, and his heart was up with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
righteousness. But the other, who seemed
to be the oldest of the three, shouted out
something, and put his leg across, and
made at the squire with a long blue thing
that shone in the sun, like a looking-glass.
And the squire, instead of turning round to
run away as he should have, led at him
with the thick end of the fishing rod, to
which he had bound an old knife of Mother
Pring’s for to stick it in the grass, while he
put his flies on. And I heard the old knife
strike the man in his breast, and down he
goes dead as a door-nail. And before I
could look again almost, another man ran
a long blade into squire, and there he was
lying as straight as a lath, with the end of
his white beard as red as a rose. At that
I was so scared that I couldn’t look no
more, and the water came bubbling into
my mouth, and I thought I was at home
along of mother.</p>

<p>“By and by, I came back to myself with
my face full of scratches in a bush, and the
sun was going low, and the place all as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
quiet as Cheriton church. But the noise
of the water told me where I was; and I
got up, and ran for the life of me, till I
came to the goyal. And then I got into
a fuzz-rick, and slept all night, for I
durstn’t go home to tell Mother Pring.
But I just took a look before I began to
run, and the Doone that was killed was
gone away, but the squire lay along with
his arms stretched out, as quiet as a sheep
before they hang him up to drain.”</p>

<span class="subhead">WISE COUNSEL.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Some pious people seem not to care how
many of their dearest hearts the Lord in
heaven takes from them. How well I
remember that in later life, I met a beautiful
young widow, who had loved her husband
with her one love, and was left with
twin babies by him. I feared to speak, for I
had known him well, and thought her the
tenderest of the tender, and my eyes were
full of tears for her. But she looked at me
with some surprise, and said: “You loved
my Bob, I know,” for he was a cousin of
my own, and as good a man as ever lived,
“but, Sylvia, you must not commit the sin
of grieving for him.”</p>

<p>It may be so, in a better world, if people
are allowed to die there; but as long as we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
are here, how can we help being as the Lord
has made us? The sin, as it seems to me,
would be to feel or fancy ourselves case-hardened
against the will of our Maker,
which so often is&mdash;that we should grieve.
Without a thought how that might be, I did
the natural thing, and cried about the death
of my dear father until I was like to follow
him. But a strange thing happened in a
month or so of time, which according to
Deborah saved my life, by compelling other
thoughts to come. My father had been
buried in a small churchyard, with nobody
living near it, and the church itself was
falling down, through scarcity of money on
the moor. The Warren, as our wood was
called, lay somewhere in the parish of
Brendon, a straggling country, with a little
village somewhere, and a blacksmith’s shop
and an ale house, but no church that anyone
knew of, till you came to a place called
Cheriton. And there was a little church
all by itself, not easy to find, though it
had four bells, which nobody dared to ring,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
for fear of his head and the burden above
it. But a boy would go up the first Sunday
of each month, and strike the liveliest of
them with a poker from the smithy. And
then a brave parson, who feared nothing
but his duty, would make his way in, with
a small flock at his heels, and read the
Psalms of the day, and preach concerning
the difficulty of doing better. And it was
accounted to the credit of the Doones that
they never came near him, for he had no
money.</p>

<p>The Fords had been excellent Catholics
always; but Thomas and Deborah Pring,
who managed everything while I was overcome,
said that the church, being now so
old, must have belonged to us, and therefor
might be considered holy. The parson
also said that it would do, for he was not
a man of hot persuasions. And so my dear
father lay there, without a stone, or a word to
tell who he was, and the grass began to grow.</p>

<p>Here I was sitting one afternoon in May,
and the earth was beginning to look lively;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
when a shadow from the west fell over me,
and a large, broad man stood behind it.
If I had been at all like myself, a thing
of that kind would have frightened me;
but now the strings of my system seemed
to have nothing like a jerk in them, for
I cared not whither I went, nor how I
looked, nor whether I went anywhere.</p>

<p>“Child! poor child!” It was a deep, soft
voice of distant yet large benevolence.
“Almost a woman, and a comely one, for
those who think of such matters. Such a
child I might have owned, if Heaven had
been kind to me.”</p>

<p>Low as I was of heart and spirit, I could
not help looking up at him; for Mother
Pring’s voice, though her meaning was so
good, sounded like a cackle in comparison
to this. But when I looked up, such encouragement
came from a great benign and
steadfast gaze that I turned away my eyes,
as I felt them overflow. But he said not
a word, for his pity was too deep, and I
thanked him in my heart for that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
“Pardon me if I am wrong,” I said, with
my eyes on the white flowers I had brought
and arranged as my father would have liked
them; “but perhaps you are the clergyman
of this old church.” For I had lain senseless
and moaning on the ground when my
father was carried away to be buried.</p>

<p>“How often am I taken for a clerk in
holy orders! And in better times I might
have been of that sacred vocation, though
so unworthy. But I am a member of the
older church, and to me all this is heresy.”</p>

<p>There was nothing of bigotry in our race,
and we knew that we must put up with all
changes for the worst; yet it pleased me
not a little that so good a man should be
also a sound Catholic.</p>

<p>“There are few of us left, and we are
persecuted. Sad calumnies are spread
about us,” this venerable man proceeded,
while I gazed on the silver locks that fell
upon his well-worn velvet coat. “But of
such things we take small heed, while we
know that the Lord is with us. Haply even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
you, young maiden, have listened to slander
about us.”</p>

<p>I told him with some concern, although
not caring much for such things now, that
I never had any chance of listening to tales
about anybody, and was yet without the
honour of even knowing who he was.</p>

<p>“Few indeed care for that point now,”
he answered, with a toss of his glistening
curls, and a lift of his broad white eyebrows.
“Though there has been a time
when the noblest of this earth&mdash;but vanity,
vanity, the wise man saith. Yet some good
I do in my quiet little way. There is a
peaceful company among these hills, respected
by all who conceive them aright.
My child, perhaps you have heard of
them?”</p>

<p>I replied sadly that I had not done so,
but hoped that he would forgive me as one
unacquainted with that neighbourhood.
But I knew that there might be godly
monks still in hiding, for the service of God
in the wilderness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
“So far as the name goes, we are not
monastics,” he said, with a sparkle in his
deep-set eyes; “we are but a family of
ancient lineage, expelled from our home in
these irreligious times. It is no longer in
our power to do all the good we would, and
therefore we are much undervalued. Perhaps
you have heard of the Doones, my
child?”</p>

<p>To me it was a wonder that he spoke of
them thus, for his look was of beautiful
mildness, instead of any just condemnation.
But his aspect was as if he came from
heaven; and I thought that he had a hard
job before him, if he were sent to conduct
the Doones thither.</p>

<p>“I am not severe; I think well of mankind,”
he went on, as I looked at him
meekly; “perhaps because I am one of
them. You are very young, my dear, and
unable to form much opinion as yet. But
let it be your rule of life ever to keep an
open mind.”</p>

<p>This advice impressed me much, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
I could not see clearly what it meant. But
the sun was going beyond Exmoor now,
and safe as I felt with so good an old man,
a long, lonely walk was before me. So I
took up my basket and rose to depart,
saying, “Good-bye, sir; I am much in
your debt for your excellent advice and
kindness.”</p>

<p>He looked at me most benevolently, and
whatever may be said of him hereafter,
I shall always believe that he was a good
man, overcome perhaps by circumstances,
yet trying to make the best of them. He
has now become a by-word as a hypocrite
and a merciless self-seeker. But many
young people, who met him as I did, without
possibility of prejudice, hold a larger
opinion of him. And surely young eyes
are the brightest.</p>

<p>“I will protect thee, my dear,” he said,
looking capable in his great width and
wisdom of protecting all the host of
heaven. “I have protected a maiden even
more beautiful than thou art. But now she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
hath unwisely fled from us. Our young
men are thoughtless, but they are not
violent, at least until they are sadly provoked.
Your father was a brave man, and
much to be esteemed. My brother, the
mildest man that ever lived, hath ridden
down hundreds of Roundheads with him.
Therefore thou shalt come to no harm.
But he should not have fallen upon our
young men as if they were rabble of the
Commonwealth.”</p>

<p>Upon these words I looked at him I
know not how, so great was the variance
betwixt my ears and eyes. Then I tried to
say something, but nothing would come, so
entire was my amazement.</p>

<p>“Such are the things we have ever to
contend with,” he continued, as if to himself,
with a smile of compassion at my
prejudice. “Nay, I am not angry; I have
seen so much of this. Right and wrong
stand fast, and cannot be changed by any
facundity. But time is short, and will soon
be stirring. Have a backway from thy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
bedroom, child. I am Councillor Doone;
by birthright and in right of understanding,
the captain of that pious family, since the
return of the good Sir Ensor to the land
where there are no lies. So long as we are
not molested in our peaceful valley, my will
is law; and I have ordered that none shall
go near thee. But a mob of country louts
are drilling in a farmyard up the moorlands,
to plunder and destroy us, if they
can. We shall make short work of them.
But after that, our youths may be provoked
beyond control, and sally forth to make
reprisal. They have their eyes on thee,
I know, and thy father hath assaulted
us. An ornament to our valley thou
wouldst be; but I would reproach myself
if the daughter of my brother’s friend
were discontented with our life. Therefore
have I come to warn thee, for there are
troublous times in front. Have a backway
from thy bedroom, child, and slip out
into the wood if a noise comes in the
night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Before I could thank him, he strode
away, with a step of no small dignity, and
as he raised his pointed hat, the western
light showed nothing fairer or more
venerable than the long wave of his silver
locks.</p>

<span class="subhead">A COTTAGE HOSPITAL.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Master Pring was not much of a man
to talk. But for power of thought he was
considered equal to any pair of other men,
and superior of course to all womankind.
Moreover, he had seen a good deal of fighting,
not among outlaws, but fine soldiers
well skilled in the proper style of it. So
that it was impossible for him to think very
highly of the Doones. Gentlemen they
might be, he said, and therefore by nature
well qualified to fight. But where could
they have learned any discipline, any tactics,
any knowledge of formation, or even any
skill of sword or firearms? “Tush, there
was his own son, Bob, now serving under
Captain Purvis, as fine a young trooper as
ever drew sword, and perhaps on his way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
at this very moment, under orders from
the Lord Lieutenant, to rid the country of
that pestilent race. Ah, ha! We soon
shall see!”</p>

<p>And in truth we did see him, even sooner
than his own dear mother had expected,
and long before his father wanted him,
though he loved him so much in his absence.
For I heard a deep voice in the
kitchen one night (before I was prepared
for such things, by making a backway out
of my bedroom), and thinking it best to
know the worst, went out to ask what was
doing there.</p>

<p>A young man was sitting upon the table,
accounting too little of our house, yet
showing no great readiness to boast, only
to let us know who he was. He had a fine
head of curly hair, and spoke with a firm
conviction that there was much inside it.
“Father, you have possessed small opportunity
of seeing how we do things now.
Mother is not to be blamed for thinking
that we are in front of what used to be.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
What do we care how the country lies? We
have heared all this stuff up at Oare. If there
are bogs, we shall timber them. If there
are rocks, we shall blow them up. If there
are caves, we shall fire down them. The
moment we get our guns into position&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush, Bob, hush! Here is your
master’s daughter. Not the interlopers
you put up with; but your real master, on
whose property you were born. Is that the
position for your guns?”</p>

<p>Being thus rebuked by his father, who
was a very faithful-minded man, Robert
Pring shuffled his long boots down, and
made me a low salutation. But, having
paid little attention to the things other
people were full of, I left the young man
to convince his parents, and he soon was
successful with his mother.</p>

<p>Two, or it may have been three days
after this, a great noise arose in the morning.
I was dusting my father’s books,
which lay open just as he had left them.
There was “Barker’s Delight” and “Isaac<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Walton,” and the “Secrets of Angling by
J.&nbsp;D.” and some notes of his own about
making of flies; also fish hooks made of
Spanish steel, and long hairs pulled from
the tail of a gray horse, with spindles and
bits of quill for plaiting them. So proud
and so pleased had he been with these
trifles, after the clamour and clash of life,
that tears came into my eyes once more,
as I thought of his tranquil and amiable
ways.</p>

<p>“’Tis a wrong thing altogether to my
mind,” cried Deborah Pring, running in
to me. “They Doones was established
afore we come, and why not let them bide
upon their own land? They treated poor
master amiss, beyond denial; and never
will I forgive them for it. All the same,
he was catching what belonged to them;
meaning for the best no doubt, because
he was so righteous. And having such
courage he killed one, or perhaps two;
though I never could have thought so
much of that old knife. But ever since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
that, they have been good, Miss Sillie,
never even coming anigh us; and I don’t
believe half of the tales about them.”</p>

<p>All this was new to me; for if anybody
had cried shame and death upon that
wicked horde, it was Deborah Pring, who
was talking to me thus! I looked at her
with wonder, suspecting for the moment
that the venerable Councillor&mdash;who was
clever enough to make a cow forget her
calf&mdash;might have paid her a visit while I
was away. But very soon the reason of
the change appeared.</p>

<p>“Who hath taken command of the
attack?” she asked, as if no one would
believe the answer; “not Captain Purvis,
as ought to have been, nor even Captain
Dallas of Devon, but Spy Stickles by royal
warrant, the man that hath been up to
Oare so long! And my son Robert, who
hath come down to help to train them, and
understandeth cannon guns&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Captain Purvis? I seem to know that
name very well. I have often heard it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
from my father. And your son under
him! Why, Deborah, what are you hiding
from me?”</p>

<p>Now good Mrs. Pring was beginning to
forget, or rather had never borne properly
in mind, that I was the head of the household
now, and entitled to know everything,
and to be asked about it. But people who
desire to have this done should insist upon
it at the outset, which I had not been in
proper state to do. So that she made quite
a grievance of it, when I would not be
treated as a helpless child. However, I
soon put a stop to that, and discovered to
my surprise much more than could be
imagined.</p>

<p>And before I could say even half of what
I thought, a great noise arose in the hollow
of the hills, and came along the valleys,
like the blowing of a wind that had picked
up the roaring of mankind upon its way.
Perhaps greater noise had never arisen
upon the moor; and the cattle, and the
quiet sheep, and even the wild deer came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
bounding from unsheltered places into any
offering of branches, or of other heling
from the turbulence of men. And then
a gray fog rolled down the valley, and
Deborah said it was cannon-smoke, following
the river course; but to me it seemed
only the usual thickness of the air, when the
clouds hang low. Thomas Pring was gone,
as behooved an ancient warrior, to see how
his successors did things, and the boy Dick
Hutchings had begged leave to sit in a tree
and watch the smoke. Deborah and I were
left alone, and a long and anxious day we
had.</p>

<p>At last the wood-pigeons had stopped
their cooing,&mdash;which they kept up for hours,
when the weather matched the light,&mdash;and
there was not a tree that could tell its own
shadow, and we were contented with the
gentle sounds that come through a forest
when it falls asleep, and Deborah Pring,
who had taken a motherly tendency toward
me now, as if to make up for my father,
was sitting in the porch with my hands in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
her lap, and telling me how to behave henceforth,
as if the whole world depended upon
that, when we heard a swishing sound, as of
branches thrust aside, and then a low moan
that went straight to my heart, as I thought
of my father when he took the blow of
death.</p>

<p>“My son, my Bob, my eldest boy!” cried
Mistress Pring, jumping up and falling into
my arms, like a pillow full of wire, for she
insisted upon her figure still. But before I
could do anything to help <span class="locked">her&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Hit her on the back, ma’am; hit her
hard upon the back. That is what always
brings mother round,” was shouted, as I
might say, into my ear by the young man
whom she was lamenting.</p>

<p>“Shut thy trap, Braggadose. To whom
art thou speaking? Pretty much thou hast
learned of war to come and give lessons to
thy father! Mistress Sylvia, it is for thee
to speak. Nothing would satisfy this young
springal but to bring his beaten captain
here, for the sake of mother’s management.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
I told un that you would never take him in,
for his father have taken in you pretty well!
Captain Purvis of the Somerset I know not
what&mdash;for the regiments now be all upside
down. <em>Raggiments</em> is the proper name for
them. Very like he be dead by this time,
and better die out of doors than in. Take
un away, Bob. No hospital here!”</p>

<p>“Thomas Pring, who are you,” I said,
for the sound of another low groan came
through me, “to give orders to your master’s
daughter? If you bring not the poor
wounded gentleman in, you shall never come
through this door yourself.”</p>

<p>“Ha, old hunks, I told thee so!”</p>

<p>The young man who spoke raised his hat
to me, and I saw that it had a scarlet plume,
such as Marwood de Wichehalse gloried in.
“In with thee, and stretch him that he may
die straight. I am off to Southmolton for
Cutcliffe Lane, who can make a furze-fagot
bloom again. My filly can give a land-yard
in a mile to Tom Faggus and his Winnie.
But mind one thing, all of you; it was none<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
of us that shot the captain, but his own
good men. Farewell, Mistress Sylvia!”
With these words he made me a very low
bow, and set off for his horse at the corner
of the wood&mdash;as reckless a gallant as ever
broke hearts, and those of his own kin foremost;
yet himself so kind and loving.</p>

<span class="subhead">MISTAKEN AIMS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Captain Purvis, now brought to the
Warren in this very sad condition, had not
been shot by his own men, as the dashing
Marwood de Wichehalse said; neither was
it quite true to say that he had been shot
by anyone. What happened to him was
simply this: While behaving with the
utmost gallantry and encouraging the
militia of Somerset, whose uniforms were
faced with yellow, he received in his chest
a terrific blow from the bottom of a bottle.
This had been discharged from a culverin
on the opposite side of the valley by the
brave but impetuous sons of Devon, who
wore the red facings, and had taken
umbrage at a pure mistake on the part
of their excellent friends and neighbours,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
the loyal band of Somerset. Either brigade
had three culverins; and never having
seen such things before, as was natural
with good farmers’ sons, they felt it a compliment
to themselves to be intrusted with
such danger, and resolved to make the
most of it. However, when they tried to
make them go, with the help of a good
many horses, upon places that had no roads
for war, and even no sort of road at all, the
difficulty was beyond them. But a very
clever blacksmith near Malmesford, who had
better, as it proved, have stuck to the plough,
persuaded them that he knew all about it,
and would bring their guns to bear, if they
let him have his way. So they took the
long tubes from their carriages, and lashed
rollers of barked oak under them, and with
very stout ropes, and great power of swearing,
dragged them into the proper place to
overwhelm the Doones.</p>

<p>Here they mounted their guns upon cider
barrels, with allowance of roll for recoil,
and charged them to the very best of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
knowledge, and pointed them as nearly as
they could guess at the dwellings of the
outlaws in the glen; three cannons on the
north were of Somerset, and the three on
the south were of Devonshire; but these
latter had no balls of metal, only anything
round they could pick up. Colonel Stickles
was in command, by virtue of his royal
warrant, and his plan was to make his chief
assault in company with some chosen men,
including his host, young farmer Ridd,
at the head of the valley where the
chief entrance was, while the trainbands
pounded away on either side. And perhaps
this would have succeeded well, except
for a little mistake in firing, for which
the enemy alone could be blamed with
justice. For while Captain Purvis was
behind the line rallying a few men who
showed fear, and not expecting any combat
yet, because Devonshire was not ready,
an elderly gentleman of great authority
appeared among the bombardiers. On his
breast he wore a badge of office, and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
his hat a noble plume of the sea eagle,
and he handed his horse to a man in red
clothes.</p>

<p>“Just in time,” he shouted; “and the
Lord be thanked for that! By order of His
Majesty, I take supreme command. Ha,
and high time, too, for it! You idiots, where
are you pointing your guns? What allowance
have you made for windage? Why, at
that elevation, you’ll shoot yourselves. Up
with your muzzles, you yellow jackanapes!
Down on your bellies! Hand me the linstock!
By the Lord, you don’t even know
how to touch them off!”</p>

<p>The soldiers were abashed at his rebukes,
and glad to lie down on their breasts for
fear of the powder on their yellow facings.
And thus they were shaken by three great
roars, and wrapped in a cloud of streaky
smoke. When this had cleared off, and
they stood up, lo! the houses of the Doones
were the same as before, but a great shriek
arose on the opposite bank, and two good
horses lay on the ground; and the red men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
were stamping about, and some crossing
their arms, and some running for their lives,
and the bravest of them stooping over one
another. Then as Captain Purvis rushed
up in great wrath, shouting: “What the
devil do you mean by this?” another
great roar arose from across the valley,
and he was lying flat, and two other
fine fellows were rolling in a furze bush
without knowledge of it. But of the general
and his horse there was no longer any
token.</p>

<p>This was the matter that lay so heavily
on the breast of Captain Purvis, sadly
crushed as it was already by the spiteful
stroke bitterly intended for him. His own
men had meant no harm whatever, unless to
the proper enemy; although they appear to
have been deluded by a subtle device of the
Councillor, for which on the other hand none
may blame him. But those redfaced men,
without any inquiry, turned the muzzles of
their guns upon Somerset, and the injustice
rankled for a generation between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
two equally honest counties. Happily they
did not fight it out through scarcity of
ammunition, as well as their mutual desire
to go home and attend to their harvest
business.</p>

<p>But Anthony Purvis, now our guest and
patient, became very difficult to manage;
not only because of his three broken ribs,
but the lowness of the heart inside them.
Dr. Cutcliffe Lane, a most cheerful man
from that cheerful town Southmolton, was
able (with the help of Providence) to make
the bones grow again without much anger
into their own embraces. It is useless,
however, for the body to pretend that it is
doing wonders on its own account, and rejoicing
and holiday making, when the thing
that sits inside it and holds the whip, keeps
down upon the slouch and is out of sorts.
And truly this was the case just now with
the soul of Captain Purvis. Deborah Pring
did her very best, and was in and out of his
room every minute, and very often seemed
to me to run him down when he deserved it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
not; on purpose that I might be started to
run him up. But nothing of that sort told
at all according to her intention. I kept
myself very much to myself; feeling that
my nature was too kind, and asking at
some little questions of behaviour, what
sort of returns my dear father had obtained
for supposing other people as good as
himself.</p>

<p>Moreover, it seemed an impossible thing
that such a brave warrior, and a rich man
too&mdash;for his father, Sir Geoffrey, was in
full possession now of all the great property
that belonged by right to us&mdash;that an
officer who should have been in command
of this fine expedition, if he had his dues,
could be either the worse or the better of
his wound, according to his glimpses of a
simple maid like me. It was useless for
Deborah Pring, or even Dr. Cutcliffe Lane
himself, to go on as they did about love at
first sight, and the rising of the heart when
the ribs were broken, and a quantity of
other stuff too foolish to repeat. “I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
neither a plaster nor a poultice,” I replied
to myself, for I would not be too cross
to them&mdash;and beyond a little peep at him,
every afternoon, I kept out of the sight of
Captain Purvis.</p>

<p>But these things made it very hard for
me to be quite sure how to conduct myself,
without father and mother to help me, and
with Mistress Pring, who had always been
such a landmark, becoming no more than a
vane for the wind to blow upon as it listed;
or, perhaps, as she listed to go with it.
And remembering how she used to speak of
the people who had ousted us, I told her
that I could not make it out. Things were
in this condition, and Captain Purvis, as it
seemed to me, quite fit to go and make war
again upon some of His Majesty’s subjects,
when a thing, altogether out of reason, or
even of civilisation, happened; and people
who live in lawful parts will accuse me of
caring too little for the truth. But even
before that came about, something less
unreasonable&mdash;but still unexpected&mdash;befell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
me. To wit, I received through Mistress
Pring an offer of marriage, immediate and
pressing, from Captain Anthony Purvis!
He must have been sadly confused by that
blow on his heart to think mine so tender,
or that this was the way to deal with it,
though later explanations proved that
Deborah, if she had been just, would have
taken the whole reproach upon herself.
The captain could scarcely have seen me, I
believe more than half a dozen times to
speak of; and generally he had shut his
eyes, gentle as they were and beautiful;
not only to make me feel less afraid, but to
fill me with pity for his weakness. Having
no knowledge of mankind as yet, I was
touched to the brink of tears at first; until
when the tray came out of his room soon
after one of these pitiful moments, it was
plain to the youngest comprehension that
the sick man had left very little upon a
shoulder of Exmoor mutton, and nothing in
a bowl of thick onion sauce.</p>

<p>For that I would be the last to blame<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
him, and being his hostess, I was glad to
find it so. But Deborah played a most
double-minded part; leading him to believe
that now she was father and mother in one
to me; while to me she went on, as if I was
most headstrong, and certain to go against
anything she said, though for her part she
never said anything. Nevertheless he made
a great mistake, as men always do, about
our ways; and having some sense of what
is right, I said, “Let me hear no more of
Captain Purvis.”</p>

<p>This forced him to leave us; which he
might have done, for aught I could see to
the contrary, a full week before he departed.
He behaved very well when he said good-bye,&mdash;for
I could not deny him that occasion,&mdash;and,
perhaps, if he had not assured
me so much of his everlasting gratitude,
I should have felt surer of deserving it.
Perhaps I was a little disappointed also,
that he expressed no anxiety at leaving our
cottage so much at the mercy of turbulent
and triumphant outlaws. But it was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
for me to speak of that; and when I knew
the reason of his silence, it redounded tenfold
to his credit. Nothing, however, vexed
me so much as what Deborah Pring said
afterward: that he could not help feeling in
the sadness of his heart that I had behaved
in that manner to him just because his
father was in possession of our rightful
home and property. I was not so small as
that; and if he truly did suppose it, there
must have been some fault on my part,
for his nature was good to everybody, and
perhaps all the better for not descending
through too many high generations.</p>

<p>There is nothing more strange than the
way things work in the mind of a woman,
when left alone, to doubt about her own
behaviour. With men it can scarcely be so
cruel; because they can always convince
themselves that they did their best; and if
it fail, they can throw the fault upon Providence,
or bad luck, or something outside
their own power. But we seem always to
be denied this happy style of thinking, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
cannot put aside what comes into our hearts
more quickly, and has less stir of outward
things, to lead it away and to brighten it.
So that I fell into sad, low spirits; and the
glory of the year began to wane, and the
forest grew more and more lonesome.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="subhead">OVER THE BRIDGE.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The sound of the woods was with me
now, both night and day, to dwell upon.
Exmoor in general is bare of trees, though
it hath the name of forest; but in the
shelter, where the wind flies over, are
many thick places full of shade. For here
the trees and bushes thrive, so copious
with rich moisture that, from the hills on
the opposite side, no eye may pick holes in
the umbrage; neither may a foot that gets
amid them be sure of getting out again.
And now was the fullest and heaviest time,
for the summer had been a wet one, after a
winter that went to our bones; and the
leaves were at their darkest tone without
any sense of autumn. As one stood
beneath and wondered at their countless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
multitude, a quick breathing passed among
them, not enough to make them move, but
seeming rather as if they wished, and yet
were half ashamed to sigh. And this was
very sad for one whose spring comes only
once for all.</p>

<p>One night toward the end of August I
was lying awake thinking of the happier
times, and wondering what the end would
be&mdash;for now we had very little money left,
and I would rather starve than die in debt&mdash;when
I heard our cottage door smashed
in and the sound of horrible voices. The
roar of a gun rang up the stairs, and the
crash of someone falling and the smoke came
through my bedroom door, and then wailing
mixed with curses. “Out of the way,
old hag!” I heard, and then another
shriek; and then I stood upon the stairs
and looked down at them. The moon was
shining through the shattered door, and
the bodies and legs of men went to and
fro, like branches in a tempest. Nobody
seemed to notice me, although I had cast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
over my night-dress&mdash;having no more sense
in the terror&mdash;a long silver coat of some
animal shot by my father in his wanderings,
and the light upon the stairs glistened
round it. Having no time to think, I was
turning to flee and jump out of my bedroom
window, for which I had made some
arrangements, according to the wisdom of
the Councillor, when the flash of some
light or the strain of my eyes showed me
the body of Thomas Pring, our faithful old
retainer, lying at the foot of the broken
door, and beside it his good wife, creeping
up to give him the last embrace of death.
And lately she had been cross to him. At
the sight of this my terror fled, and I cared
not what became of me. Buckling the
white skin round my waist, I went down
the stairs as steadily as if it were breakfast
time, and said:</p>

<p>“Brutes, murderers, cowards! you have
slain my father; now slay me!”</p>

<p>Every one of those wicked men stood up
and fixed his eyes on me; and if it had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
a time to laugh, their amazement might
have been laughed at. Some of them took
me for a spirit&mdash;as I was told long afterward&mdash;and
rightly enough their evil hearts
were struck with dread of judgment. But
even so, to scare them long in their contemptuous,
godless vein was beyond the
power of Heaven itself; and when one of
my long tresses fell, to my great vexation,
down my breast, a shocking sneer arose,
and words unfit for a maiden’s ear ensued.</p>

<p>“None of that! This is no farmhouse
wench, but a lady of birth and breeding.
She shall be our queen, instead of the one
that hath been filched away. Sylvia, thou
shalt come with me.”</p>

<p>The man who spoke with this mighty
voice was a terror to the others, for they
fell away before him, and he was the
biggest monster there&mdash;Carver Doone,
whose name for many a generation shall be
used to frighten unruly babes to bed. And
now, as he strode up to me and bowed,&mdash;to
show some breeding,&mdash;I doubt if the moon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
in all her rounds of earth and sky and the
realms below, fell ever upon another face
so cold, repulsive, ruthless.</p>

<p>To belong to him, to feel his lips, to
touch him with anything but a dagger!
Suddenly I saw my father’s sword hanging
under a beam in the scabbard. With a
quick spring I seized it, and, leaping up the
stairs, had the long blade gleaming in the
moonlight. The staircase would not hold
two people abreast, and the stairs were as
steep as narrow. I brought the point down
it, with the hilt against my breast, and there
was no room for another blade to swing and
strike it up.</p>

<p>“Let her alone!” said Carver Doone,
with a smile upon his cold and corpselike
face. “My sons, let the lady have her
time. She is worthy to be the mother of
many a fine Doone.”</p>

<p>The young men began to lounge about
in a manner most provoking, as if I had
passed from their minds altogether; and
some of them went to the kitchen for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
victuals, and grumbled at our fare by the
light of a lantern which they had found
upon a shelf. But I stood at my post, with
my heart beating, so that the long sword
quivered like a candle. Of my life they
might rob me, but of my honour, never!</p>

<p>“Beautiful maiden! Who hath ever seen
the like? Why, even Lorna hath not such
eyes.”</p>

<p>Carver Doone came to the foot of the
stairs and flashed the lantern at me, and,
thinking that he meant to make a rush for
it, I thrust my weapon forward; but at the
same moment a great pair of arms was
thrown around me from behind by some
villain who must have scaled my chamber
window, and backward I fell, with no sense
or power left.</p>

<p>When my scattered wits came back I felt
that I was being shaken grievously, and the
moon was dancing in my eyes through a
mist of tears, half blinding them. I remember
how hard I tried to get my fingers
up to wipe my eyes, so as to obtain some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
knowledge; but jerk and bump and helpless
wonder were all that I could get or take;
for my hands were strapped, and my feet
likewise, and I seemed like a wave going
up and down, without any judgment, upon
the open sea.</p>

<p>But presently I smelled the wholesome
smell which a horse of all animals alone
possesses, though sometimes a cow is almost
as good, and then I felt a mane coming into
my hair, and then there was the sound of
steady feet moving just under me, with rise
and fall and swing alternate, and a sense
of going forward. I was on the back of a
great, strong horse, and he was obeying the
commands of man. Gradually I began to
think, and understood my awful plight.
The Doones were taking me to Doone Glen
to be some cut-throat’s light-of-love; perhaps
to be passed from brute to brute&mdash;me,
Sylvia Ford, my father’s darling, a proud
and dainty and stately maiden, of as good
birth as any in this English realm. My
heart broke down as I thought of that, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
all discretion vanished. Though my hands
were tied my throat was free, and I sent
forth such a scream of woe that the many-winding
vale of Lynn, with all its wild
waters could not drown, nor with all its
dumb foliage smother it; and the long wail
rang from crag to crag, as the wrongs of
men echo unto the ears of God.</p>

<p>“Valiant damsel, what a voice thou hast!
Again, and again let it strike the skies.
With them we are at peace, being persecuted
here, according to the doom of all
good men. And yet I am loth to have that
fair throat strained.”</p>

<p>It was Carver Doone who led my horse;
and his horrible visage glared into my eyes
through the strange, wan light that flows
between the departure of the sinking moon
and the flutter of the morning when it cannot
see its way. I strove to look at him;
but my scared eyes fell, and he bound his
rank glove across my poor lips. “Let it be
so,” I thought; “I can do no more.”</p>

<p>Then, when my heart was quite gone in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
despair, and all trouble shrank into a trifle,
I heard a loud shout, and the trample of
feet, and the rattle of arms, and the clash
of horses. Contriving to twist myself a
little, I saw that the band of the Doones
were mounting a saddle-backed bridge in
a deep wooded glen, with a roaring water
under them. On the crown of the bridge a
vast man stood, such as I had never descried
before, bearing no armour that I could see,
but wearing a farmer’s hat, and raising a
staff like the stem of a young oak tree. He
was striking at no one, but playing with his
staff, as if it were a willow in the morning
breeze.</p>

<p>“Down with him! Ride him down! Send
a bullet through him!” several of the
Doones called out, but no one showed any
hurry to do it. It seemed as if they knew
him, and feared his mighty strength, and
their guns were now slung behind their
backs on account of the roughness of the
way.</p>

<p>“Charlie, you are not afraid of him,” I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
heard that crafty Carver say to the tallest
of his villains, and a very handsome young
man he was; “if the girl were not on my
horse, I would do it. Ride over him, and
you shall have my prize, when I am tired
of her.”</p>

<p>I felt the fire come into my eyes, to be
spoken of so by a brute; and then I saw
Charlie Doone spur up the bridge, leaning
forward and swinging a long blade round
his head.</p>

<p>“Down with thee, clod!” he shouted;
and he showed such strength and fury that
I scarce could look at the farmer, dreading
to see his great head fly away. But just as
the horse rushed at him, he leaped aside
with most wonderful nimbleness, and the
rider’s sword was dashed out of his grasp,
and down he went, over the back of the
saddle, and his long legs spun up in the air,
as a juggler tosses a two-pronged fork.</p>

<p>“Now for another!” the farmer cried,
and his deep voice rang above the roar of
Lynn; “or two at once, if it suits you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
better. I will teach you to carry off women,
you dogs!”</p>

<p>But the outlaws would not try another
charge. On a word from their leader they
all dismounted, and were bringing their
long guns to bear, and I heard the clink
of their flints as they fixed the trigger.
Carver Doone, grinding his enormous
teeth, stood at the head of my horse, who
was lashing and plunging, so that I must
have been flung if any of the straps had
given way. In terror of the gun flash I
shut my eyes, for if I had seen that brave
man killed, it would have been the death
of me as well. Then I felt my horse
treading on something soft. Carver Doone
was beneath his feet, and an awful curse
came from the earth.</p>

<p>“Have no fear!” said the sweetest voice
that ever came into the ears of despair.
“Sylvia, none can harm you now. Lie
still, and let this protect your face.”</p>

<p>“How can I help lying still?” I said,
as a soft cloak was thrown over me, and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
less than a moment my horse was rushing
through branches and brushwood that
swept his ears. At his side was another
horse, and my bridle rein was held by a
man who stooped over his neck in silence.
Though his face was out of sight, I knew
that Anthony Purvis was leading me.</p>

<p>There was no possibility of speaking
now, but after a tumult of speed we came
to an open glade where the trees fell back,
and a gentle brook was gurgling. Then
Captain Purvis cut my bonds, and lifting
me down very softly, set me upon a bank
of moss, for my limbs would not support
me; and I lay there unable to do anything
but weep.</p>

<p>When I returned to myself, the sun was
just looking over a wooded cliff, and
Anthony, holding a horn of water, and with
water on his cheeks, was regarding me.</p>

<p>“Did you leave that brave man to be
shot?” I asked, as if that were all my
gratitude.</p>

<p>“I am not so bad as that,” he answered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
without any anger, for he saw that I was
not in reason yet. “At sight of my men,
although we were but five in all, the robbers
fled, thinking the regiment was there; but
it is God’s truth that I thought little of
anyone’s peril compared with thine. But
there need be no fear for John Ridd; the
Doones are mighty afraid of him since he
cast their culverin through their door.”</p>

<p>“Was that the John Ridd I have heard
so much of? Surely I might have known
it, but my wits were shaken out of me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that was the mighty man of
Exmoor, to whom thou owest more than
life.”</p>

<p>In horror of what I had so narrowly
escaped, I fell upon my knees and thanked
the Lord, and then I went shyly to the
captain’s side and said: “I am ashamed to
look at thee. Without Anthony Purvis,
where should I be? Speak of no John
Ridd to me.”</p>

<p>For this man whom I had cast forth,
with coldness, as he must have thought&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>although
I knew better, when he was gone&mdash;this
man (my honoured husband now, who
hath restored me to my father’s place,
when kings had no gratitude or justice), Sir
Anthony Purvis, as now he is, had dwelled
in a hovel and lived on scraps, to guard the
forsaken orphan, who had won, and shall
ever retain, his love.</p>

<h2><a id="FRIDA"></a>FRIDA; OR, THE LOVER’S LEAP.<br />

<span class="subhead">A LEGEND OF THE WEST COUNTRY.</span></h2>
</div>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>On the very day when Charles I. was
crowned with due rejoicings&mdash;Candlemas-day,
in the year of our Lord 1626&mdash;a loyalty,
quite as deep and perhaps even more lasting,
was having its beer at Ley Manor in
the north of Devon. A loyalty not to the
king, for the old West-country folk knew
little and cared less about the house that
came over the Border; but to a lord who
had won their hearts by dwelling among
them, and dealing kindly, and paying his
way every Saturday night. When this has
been done for three generations general and
genial respect may almost be relied upon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
The present Baron de Wichehalse was
fourth in descent from that Hugh de Wichehalse,
the head of an old and wealthy race,
who had sacrificed his comfort to his resolve
to have a will of his own in matters of
religion. That Hugh de Wichehalse, having
an eye to this, as well as the other world,
contrived to sell his large estates before they
were confiscated, and to escape with all the
money, from very sharp measures then
enforced, by order of King Philip II., in
the unhappy Low Countries. Landing in
England, with all his effects and a score of
trusty followers, he bought a fine property,
settled, and died, and left a good name
behind him. And that good name had
been well kept up, and the property had
increased and thriven, so that the present
lord was loved and admired by all the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>In one thing, however, he had been
unlucky, at least in his own opinion. Ten
years of married life had not found issue in
parental life. All his beautiful rocks and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
hills, lovely streams and glorious woods,
green meadows and golden corn lands, must
pass to his nephew and not to his child,
because he had not gained one. Being a
good man, he did his best to see this thing
in its proper light. Children, after all, are
a plague, a risk, and a deep anxiety. His
nephew was a very worthy boy, and his
rights should be respected. Nevertheless,
the baron often longed to supersede them.</p>

<p>Of this there was every prospect now.
The lady of the house had intrusted her
case to a highly celebrated simple-woman,
who lived among rocks and scanty vegetation
at Heddon’s Mouth, gathering wisdom
from the earth and from the sea tranquillity.
De Wichehalse was naturally vexed a
little when all this accumulated wisdom
culminated in nothing grander than a somewhat
undersized, and unhappily female
child&mdash;one, moreover, whose presence cost
him that of his faithful and loving wife.
So that the heiress of Ley Manor was
greeted, after all, with a very brief and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
sorry welcome. “Jennyfried,” for so they
named her, soon began to grow into a fair
esteem and good liking. Her father, after
a year or two, plucked up his courage and
played with her; and the more he played
the more pleased he was, both with her and
his own kind self. Unhappily, there were
at that time no shops in the neighbourhood;
unhappily, now there are too many.
Nevertheless, upon the whole, she had all
the toys that were good for her; and her
teeth had a fair chance of fitting themselves
for life’s chief operation in the absence of
sugared allurements.</p>

<p>A brief and meagre account is this of the
birth, and growth, and condition of a
maiden whose beauty and goodness still
linger in the winter tales of many a simple
homestead. For, sharing her father’s
genial nature, she went about among the
people in her soft and playful way; knowing
all their cares, and gifted with a kindly
wonder at them, which is very soothing.
All the simple folk expected condescension<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
from her; and she would have let them
have it, if she had possessed it.</p>

<p>At last she was come to a time of life
when maidens really must begin to consider
their responsibilities&mdash;a time when it does
matter how the dress sits and what it is
made of, and whether the hair is well
arranged for dancing in the sunshine and
for fluttering in the moonlight; also that
the eyes convey not from that roguish nook
the heart any betrayal of “hide and seek”;
neither must the risk of blushing tremble
on perpetual brinks; neither must&mdash;but, in
a word, ’twas the seventeenth year of a
maiden’s life.</p>

<p>More and more such matters gained on
her motherless necessity. Strictly anxious
as she was to do the right thing always, she
felt more and more upon every occasion
(unless it was something particular) that
her cousin need not so impress his cousinly
salutation.</p>

<p>Albert de Wichehalse (who received that
name before it became so inevitable) was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
that same worthy boy grown up as to
whom the baron had felt compunctions,
highly honourable to either party, touching
his defeasance; or rather, perhaps, as to
interception of his presumptive heirship by
the said Albert, or at least by his mother
contemplated. And Albert’s father had
entrusted him to his uncle’s special care
and love, having comfortably made up
his mind, before he left this evil world,
that his son should have a good slice
of it.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, the baron’s chief desire
was to heal all breaches and make things
pleasant, and to keep all the family property
snug by marrying his fair Jennyfried
(or “Frida,” as she was called at home) to
her cousin Albert, now a fine young fellow
of five-and-twenty. De Wichehalse was
strongly attached to his nephew, and failed
to see any good reason why a certain large
farm near Martinhoe, quite a huge cantle
from the Ley estates, which by a prior
devise must fall to Albert upon his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
demise, should be allowed to depart in that
way from his posthumous control.</p>

<p>However, like most of our fallible race,
he went the worst possible way to work in
pursuit of his favourite purpose. He threw
the young people together daily, and dinned
into the ears of each perpetual praise of the
other. This seemed to answer well enough
in the case of the simple Albert. He could
never have too much of his lively cousin’s
company, neither could he weary of sounding
her sweet excellence. But with the
young maid it was not so. She liked the
good Albert well enough, and never got out
of his way at all. Moreover, sometimes his
curly hair and bright moustache, when they
came too near, would raise not a positive
flutter, perhaps, but a sense of some fugitive
movement in the unexplored distances
of the heart. Still, this might go on for
years, and nothing more to come of it.
Frida loved her father best of all the world,
at present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
</div>

<p>There happened to be at this time an old
fogy&mdash;of course it is most distressing to
speak of anyone disrespectfully; but when
one thinks of the trouble he caused, and
not only that, but he was an old fogy,
essentially and pre-eminently&mdash;and his
name was Sir Maunder Meddleby. This
worthy baronet, one of the first of a newly
invented order, came in his sled stuffed
with goose-feathers (because he was too fat
to ride, and no wheels were yet known on
the hill tracks) to talk about some exchange
of land with his old friend, our De Wichehalse.
The baron and the baronet had
been making a happy day of it. Each knew
pretty well exactly what his neighbour’s
little rashness might be hoped to lead to,
and each in his mind was pretty sure of
having the upper hand of it. Therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
both their hearts were open&mdash;business being
now dismissed, and dinner over&mdash;to one
another. They sat in a beautiful place,
and drew refreshment of mind through
their outward lips by means of long reeden
tubes with bowls at their ends, and something
burning.</p>

<p>Clouds of delicate vapour wandered round
and betwixt them and the sea; and each was
well content to wonder whether the time
need ever come when he must have to think
again. Suddenly a light form flitted over
the rocks, as the shadows flit; and though
Frida ran away for fear of interrupting
them, they knew who it was, and both, of
course, began to think about her.</p>

<p>The baron gave a puff of his pipe, and left
the baronet to begin. In course of time Sir
Maunder spoke, with all that breadth and
beauty of the vowels and the other things
which a Devonshire man commands, from
the lord lieutenant downward.</p>

<p>“If so be that ’ee gooth vor to ax me, ai
can zay wan thing, and wan oney.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
“What one thing is it, good neighbour?
I am well content with her as she is.”</p>

<p>“Laikely enough. And ’e wad be zo till
’e zeed a zummut fainer.”</p>

<p>“I want to see nothing finer or better
than what we have seen just now, sir.”</p>

<p>“There, you be like all varthers, a’most!
No zort o’ oose to advaise ’un.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay! Far otherwise. I am not by
any means of that nature. Sir Maunder
Meddleby, I have the honour of craving your
opinion.”</p>

<p>Sir Maunder Meddleby thought for a
while, or, at any rate, meant to be thinking,
ere ever he dared to deliver himself of
all his weighty judgment.</p>

<p>“I’ve a-knowed she, my Lord Witcher,
ever since her wore that haigh. A purty
wanch, and a peart one. But her wanteth
the vinish of the coort. Never do no good
wi’out un, whan a coomth, as her must, to
coorting.”</p>

<p>This was the very thing De Wichehalse
was afraid to hear of. He had lived so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
mild a life among the folk who loved him
that any fear of worry in great places was
too much for him. And yet sometimes he
could not help a little prick of thought
about his duty to his daughter. Hence it
came that common sense was driven wild
by conscience, as forever happens with the
few who keep that gadfly. Six great horses,
who knew no conscience but had more
fleshly tormentors, were ordered out, and
the journey began, and at last it ended.</p>

<p>Everything in London now was going
almost anyhow. Kind and worthy people
scarcely knew the way to look at things.
They desired to respect the king and all his
privilege, and yet they found his mind so
wayward that they had no hold of him.</p>

<p>The court, however, was doing its best,
from place to place in its wanderings, to
despise the uproar and enjoy itself as it
used to do. Bright and beautiful ladies
gathered round the king, when the queen
was gone, persuading him and one another
that they must have their own way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Of the lords who helped these ladies to
their strong opinions there was none in
higher favour with the queen and the king
himself than the young Lord Auberley. His
dress was like a sweet enchantment, and his
tongue was finer still, and his grace and
beauty were as if no earth existed. Frida
was a new thing to him, in her pure simplicity.
He to her was such a marvel, such
a mirror of the skies, as a maid can only
dream of in the full moon of St. John.</p>

<p>Little dainty glance, and flushing, and
the fear to look too much, and the stealthy
joy of feeling that there must be something
meant, yet the terror of believing anything
in earnest and the hope that, after all, there
may be nought to come of it; and when this
hope seems over true, the hollow of the
heart behind it, and the longing to be at home
with anyone to love oneself&mdash;time is wasted
in recounting this that always must be.</p>

<p>Enough that Frida loved this gallant from
the depths of her pure heart, while he admired
and loved her to the best of his ability.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
</div>

<p>The worthy baron was not of a versatile
complexion. When his mind was quite
made up he carried out the whole of it.
But he could not now make up his mind
upon either of two questions. Of these
questions one was this&mdash;should he fight for
the king or against him, in the struggle
now begun? By hereditary instincts he
was stanch for liberty, for letting people
have their own opinions who could pay for
them. And about religious matters and
the royal view of them, he fell under sore
misgiving that his grandfather on high
would have a bone to pick with him.</p>

<p>His other difficulty was what to say, or
what to think, about Lord Auberley. To
his own plain way of judging, and that
human instinct which, when highly cultivated,
equals that of the weaker dogs, also to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
his recollection of what used to be expected
in the time when he was young, Viscount
Auberley did not give perfect satisfaction.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, being governed as strong
folk are by the gentle ones, the worthy
baron winked at little things which did not
please him, and went so far as to ask that
noble spark to flash upon the natives of
benighted Devon. Lord Auberley was glad
enough to retire for a season, both for
other reasons and because he saw that
bitter fighting must be soon expected.
Hence it happened that the six great
Flemish horses were buckled to, early in
September of the first year of the civil war,
while the king was on his westward march
collecting men and money. The queen
was not expected back from the Continent
for another month; there had scarcely been
for all the summer even the semblance of a
court fit to teach a maiden lofty carriage
and cold dignity; so that Lord de Wichehalse
thought Sir Maunder Meddleby an
oaf for sending him to London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
But there was someone who had tasted
strong delight and shuddering fear, glowing
hope and chill despair, triumph, shame,
and all confusion of the heart and mind
and will, such as simple maidens hug into
their blushing chastity by the moonlight of
first love. Frida de Wichehalse knew for
certain, and forever felt it settled, that in
all the world of worlds never had been any
body, any mind, or even soul, fit to think
of twice when once you had beheld Lord
Auberley.</p>

<p>His young lordship, on the whole, was
much of the same opinion. Low fellows
must not have the honour to discharge their
guns at him. He liked the king, and really
meant no harm whatever to his peace of
mind concerning his Henrietta; and, if the
worst came to the worst, everyone knew
that out of France there was no swordsman
fit to meet, even with a rapier, the foil of
Aubyn Auberley. Neither was it any slur
upon his loyalty or courage that he was
now going westward from the world of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
camps and war. It was important to
secure the wavering De Wichehalse, the
leading man of all the coast, from Minehead
down to Hartland; so that, with the
full consent of all the king’s advisers, Lord
Auberley left court and camp to press his
own suit peacefully. What a difference he
found it to be here in mid-September, far
away from any knowledge of the world and
every care; only to behold the manner of
the trees disrobing, blushing with a trembling
wonder at the freedom of the winds,
or in the wealth of deep wood browning into
rich defiance; only to observe the colour of
the hills, and cliffs, and glens, and the glory
of the sea underneath the peace of heaven,
when the balanced sun was striking level
light all over them! And if this were not
enough to make a man contented with his
littleness and largeness, then to see the
freshened Pleiads, after their long dip of
night, over the eastern waters twinkling,
glad to see us all once more and sparkling
to be counted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
These things, and a thousand others,
which (without a waft of knowledge or of
thought on our part) enter into and become
our sweetest recollections, for the gay
young lord possessed no charm, nor even
interest. “Dull, dull, how dull it is!” was
all he thought when he thought at all; and
he vexed his host by asking how he could
live in such a hole as that. And he would
have vexed his young love, too, if young
love were not so large of heart, by asking
what the foreign tongue was which “her
people” tried to speak. “Their native
tongue and mine, my lord!” cried Frida,
with the sweetness of her smile less true
than usual, because she loved her people
and the air of her nativity.</p>

<p>However, take it altogether, this was a
golden time for her. Golden trust and
reliance are the well-spring of our nature,
and that man is the happiest who is cheated
every day almost. The pleasure is tenfold
as great in being cheated as to cheat.
Therefore Frida was as happy as the day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
and night are long. Though the trees
were striped with autumn, and the green of
the fields was waning, and the puce of the
heath was faded into dingy cinamon;
though the tint of the rocks was darkened
by the nightly rain and damp, and the clear
brooks were beginning to be hoarse with
shivering floods, and the only flowers left
were but widows of the sun, yet she had
the sovereign comfort and the cheer of
trustful love. Lord Auberley, though he
cared nought for the Valley of Rocks or
Watersmeet, for beetling majesty of the
cliffs or mantled curves of Woody Bay,
and though he accounted the land a wilderness
and the inhabitants savages, had
taken a favourable view of the ample spread
of the inland farms and the loyalty of the
tenants, which naturally suggested the raising
of the rental. Therefore he grew more
attentive to young Mistress Frida; even
sitting in shady places, which it made him
damp to think of when he turned his eyes
from her. Also he was moved a little by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
her growing beauty, for now the return to
her native hills, the presence of her lover,
and the home-made bread and forest mutton,
combining with her dainty years, were
making her look wonderful. If Aubyn
Auberley had not been despoiled of all true
manliness, by the petting and the forward
wit of many a foreign lady, he might have
won the pure salvation of an earnest love.
But, when judged by that French standard
which was now supreme at court, this poor
Frida was a rustic, only fit to go to school.</p>

<p>There was another fine young fellow who
thought wholly otherwise. To him, in his
simple power of judging for himself, and
seldom budging from that judgment, there
was no one fit to dream of in comparison
with her. Often, in this state of mind, he
longed to come forward and let them know
what he thought concerning the whole of
it. But Albert could not see his way
toward doing any good with it, and being
of a bashful mind, he kept his heart in
order.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
</div>

<p>The stir of the general rising of the kingdom
against the king had not disturbed
these places yet beyond what might be
borne with. Everybody liked to talk, and
everybody else was ready to put in a word
or two; broken heads, however, were as
yet the only issue. So that when there
came great news of a real battle fought,
and lost by Englishmen against Englishmen,
the indignation of all the country ran
against both parties.</p>

<p>Baron de Wichehalse had been thinking,
after his crop of hay was in,&mdash;for such a
faithful hay they have that it will not go
from root to rick by less than two months
of worrying,&mdash;from time to time, and even
in the middle of his haycocks, this good
lord had not been able to perceive his
proper course. Arguments there were that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
sounded quite as if a baby must be perfectly
convinced by them; and then there
would be quite a different line of reason
taken by someone who knew all about it
and despised the opposite. So that many
of a less decided way of thinking every day
embraced whatever had been last confuted.</p>

<p>This most manly view of matters and
desire to give fair play was scorned, of
course, by the fairer (and unfairer) half of
men. Frida counted all as traitors who
opposed their liege the king.</p>

<p>“Go forth, my lord; go forth and fight,”
she cried to Viscount Auberley, when the
doubtful combat of Edgehill was firing new
pugnacity; “if I were a man, think you
that I would let them do so?”</p>

<p>“Alas, fair mistress! it will take a many
men to help it. But since you bid me thus
away&mdash;hi, Dixon! get my trunks packed!”
And then, of course, her blushing roses
faded to a lily white; and then, of course,
it was his duty to support her slender form;
neither were those dulcet murmurs absent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
which forever must be present when the
female kind begin to have the best of it.</p>

<p>So they went on once or twice, and would
have gone on fifty times if fortune had
allowed them thus to hang on one another.
All the world was fair around them; and
themselves, as fair as any, vouched the
whole world to attest their everlasting
constancy.</p>

<p>But one soft November evening, when
the trees were full of drops, and gentle
mists were creeping up the channels of the
moorlands, and snipes (come home from
foreign parts) were cheeping at their borings,
and every weary man was gladdened
by the glance of a bright wood fire, and
smell of what was over it, there happened
to come, on a jaded horse, a man, all hat,
and cape, and boots, and mud, and sweat,
and grumbling. All the people saw at once
that it was quite impossible to make at all
too much of him, because he must be full
of news, which (after victuals) is the
greatest need of human nature. So he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
had his own way as to everything he
ordered; and, having ridden into much
experience of women, kept himself as warm
as could be, without any jealousy.</p>

<p>This stern man bore urgent order for
the Viscount Auberley to join the king at
once at Oxford, and bring with him all his
gathering. Having gathered no men yet,
but spent the time in plucking roses and
the wild myrtles of Devonshire love, the
young lord was for once a little taken
aback at this order. Moreover, though he
had been grumbling, half a dozen times a
day&mdash;to make himself more precious&mdash;about
the place, and the people, and the
way they cooked his meals, he really meant
it less and less as he came to know the
neighbourhood. These are things which
nobody can understand without seeing
them.</p>

<p>“I grieve, my lord,” said the worthy
baron, “that you must leave us in this hot
haste.” On the whole, however, this excellent
man was partly glad to be quit of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
“And I am deeply indebted to your
lordship for the grievance; but it must be
so. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Que voulez-vous?</i> You talk the French,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon baron</i>?”</p>

<p>“With a Frenchman, my lord; but not
when I have the honour to speak with an
Englishman.”</p>

<p>“Ah, there! Foreign again! My lord,
you will never speak English.”</p>

<p>De Wichehalse could never be quite sure,
though his race had been long in this country,
whether he or they could speak born
English as it ought to be.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will find,” he said at last,
with grief as well as courtesy, “many who
speak one language striving to silence one
another.”</p>

<p>“He fights best who fights the longest.
You will come with us, my lord?”</p>

<p>“Not a foot, not half an inch,” the baron
answered sturdily. “I’ve a-laboured hard
to zee my best, and ’a can’t zee head nor
tail to it.”</p>

<p>Thus he spoke in imitation of what his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
leading tenant said, smiling brightly at himself,
but sadly at his subject.</p>

<p>“Even so!” the young man answered;
“I will forth and pay my duty. The rusty
weathercock, my lord, is often too late for
the oiling.”</p>

<p>With this conceit he left De Wichehalse,
and, while his grooms were making ready,
sauntered down the zigzag path, which,
through rocks and stubbed oaks, made
toward the rugged headland known, far up
and down the Channel, by the name of
Duty Point. Near the end of this walk
there lurked a soft and silent bower, made
by Nature, and with all of Nature’s art
secluded. The ledge that wound along the
rock-front widened, and the rock fell back
and left a little cove, retiring into moss and
ferny shade. Here the maid was well
accustomed every day to sit and think,
gazing down at the calm, gray sea, and
filled with rich content and deep capacity of
dreaming.</p>

<p>Here she was, at the present moment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
resting in her pure love-dream, believing all
the world as good, and true, and kind as
her own young self. Round her all was
calm and lovely; and the soft brown hand
of autumn, with the sun’s approval, tempered
every mellow mood of leaves.</p>

<p>Aubyn Auberley was not of a sentimental
cast of mind. He liked the poets of the
day, whenever he deigned to read them;
nor was he at all above accepting the dedication
of a book. But it was not the
fashion now&mdash;as had been in the noble time
of Watson, Raleigh, and Shakspere&mdash;for
men to look around and love the greater
things they grow among.</p>

<p>Frida was surprised to see her dainty lord
so early. She came here in the morning
always, when it did not rain too hard, to let
her mind have pasture on the landscape of
sweet memory. And even sweeter hope
was always fluttering in the distance, on the
sea, or clouds, or flitting vapour of the
morning. Even so she now was looking at
the mounting glory of the sun above the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
sea-clouds, the sun that lay along the land,
and made the distance roll away.</p>

<p>“Hard and bitter is my task,” the gallant
lord began with her, “to say farewell to all
I love. But so it ever must be.”</p>

<p>Frida looked at his riding-dress, and cold
fear seized her suddenly, and then warm
hope that he might only be riding after the
bustards.</p>

<p>“My lord,” she said, “will you never
grant me that one little prayer of mine&mdash;to
spare poor birds, and make those cruel
gaze-hounds run down one another?”</p>

<p>“I shall never see the gaze-hounds
more,” he answered petulantly; “my time
for sport is over. I must set forth for the
war to-day.”</p>

<p>“To-day!” she cried; and then tried to
say a little more for pride’s sake; “to go
to the war to-day, my lord!”</p>

<p>“Alas! it is too true. Either I must
go, or be a traitor and a dastard.”</p>

<p>Her soft blue eyes lay full on his, and
tears that had not time to flow began to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
spread a hazy veil between her and the one
she loved.</p>

<p>He saw it, and he saw the rise and sinking
of her wounded heart, and how the
words she tried to utter fell away and died
within her for the want of courage; and
light and hard, and mainly selfish as his
nature was, the strength, and depth, and
truth of love came nigh to scare him for
the moment even of his vanities.</p>

<p>“Frida!” he said, with her hand in his,
and bending one knee on the moss; “only
tell me that I must stay; then stay I will;
the rest of the world may scorn if you
approve me.”</p>

<p>This, of course, sounded very well and
pleased her, as it was meant to do; still,
it did not satisfy her&mdash;so exacting are
young maidens, and so keen is the ear of
love.</p>

<p>“Aubyn, you are good and true. How
very good and true you are! But even by
your dear voice now I know what you are
thinking.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
Lord Auberley, by this time, was as well
within himself again as he generally found
himself; so that he began to balance
chances very knowingly. If the king
should win the warfare and be paramount
again, this bright star of the court must
rise to something infinitely higher than a
Devonshire squire’s child. A fine young
widow of a duke, of the royal blood of
France itself, was not far from being quite
determined to accept him, if she only
could be certain how these things would
end themselves. Many other ladies
were determined quite as bravely to wait
the course of events, and let him have
them, if convenient. On the other hand,
if the kingdom should succeed in keeping
the king in order&mdash;which was the
utmost then intended&mdash;Aubyn Auberley
might be only too glad to fall back upon
Frida.</p>

<p>Thinking it wiser, upon the whole, to
make sure of this little lamb, with nobler
game in prospect, Lord Auberley heaved as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
deep a sigh as the size of his chest could
compass. After which he spoke as follows,
in a most delicious tone:</p>

<p>“Sweetest, and my only hope, the one
star of my wanderings; although you send
me forth to battle, where my arm is needed,
give me one dear pledge that ever you will
live and die my own.”</p>

<p>This was just what Frida wanted, having
trust (as our free-traders, by vast amplitude
of vision, have in reciprocity) that if a man
gets the best of a woman he is sure to give
it back. Therefore these two sealed and
delivered certain treaties (all unwritten, but
forever engraven upon the best and tenderest
feelings of the lofty human nature)
that nothing less than death, or even
greater, should divide them.</p>

<p>Is there one, among the many who survive
such process, unable to imagine or
remember how they parted? The fierce
and even desperate anguish, nursed and
made the most of; the pride and self-control
that keep such things for comfort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
afterward; the falling of the heart that
feels itself the true thing after all. Let it
be so, since it must be; and no sympathy
can heal it, since in every case it never,
never, was so bad before!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>
</div>

<p>Lovers come, and lovers go; ecstasies
of joy and anguish have their proper intervals;
and good young folk, who know
no better, revel in high misery. But the
sun ascends the heavens at the same hour
of the day, by himself dictated; and if we
see him not, it is our earth that spreads
the curtain. Nevertheless, these lovers,
being out of rule with everything, heap
their own faults on his head, and want him
to be setting always, that they may behold
the moon.</p>

<p>Therefore it was useless for the wisest
man in the north of Devon, or even the
wisest woman, to reason with young Frida
now, or even to let her have the reason
upon her side, and be sure of it. She, for
her part, was astray from all the bounds of
reason, soaring on the wings of faith, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
hope, and high delusion. Though the
winter-time was coming, and the wind was
damp and raw, and the beauty of the
valleys lay down to recover itself; yet with
her the spring was breaking, and the world
was lifting with the glory underneath it.
Because it had been firmly pledged&mdash;and
who could ever doubt it?&mdash;that the best
and noblest lover in this world of noble
love would come and grandly claim and win
his bride on her next birthday.</p>

<p>At Christmas she had further pledge of
her noble lover’s constancy. In spite of
difficulties, dangers, and the pressing need
of men, he contrived to send her by some
very valiant messengers (none of whom
would ride alone) a beautiful portrait of
himself, set round with sparkling diamonds;
also a necklace of large pearls, as white and
pure as the neck whose grace was to
enhance their beauty.</p>

<p>Hereupon such pride and pleasure
mounted into her cheeks and eyes, and
flushed her with young gaiety, that all who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
loved her, being grafted with good superstition,
nearly spoiled their Christmas-time
by serious sagacity. She, however, in the
wealth of all she had to think of, heeded
none who trod the line of prudence and
cold certainty.</p>

<p>“It is more than I can tell,” she used to
say, most prettily, to anybody who made
bold to ask her about anything; “all
things go so in and out that I am sure of
nothing else except that I am happy.”</p>

<p>The baron now began to take a narrow,
perhaps a natural, view of all the things
around him. In all the world there was for
him no sign or semblance of any being
whose desires or strictest rights could be
thought of more than once when set against
his daughter’s. This, of course, was very
bad for Frida’s own improvement. It
could not make her selfish yet, but it really
made her wayward. The very best girls
ever seen are sure to have their failings;
and Frida, though one of the very best,
was not above all nature. People made too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
much of this, when she could no more
defend herself.</p>

<p>Whoever may have been to blame, one
thing at least is certain&mdash;the father, though
he could not follow all his child’s precipitance,
yet was well contented now to stoop
his gray head to bright lips, and do his best
toward believing some of their soft eloquence.
The child, on the other hand, was
full of pride, and rose on tiptoe, lest anybody
might suppose her still too young for
anything. Thus between them they looked
forward to a pleasant time to come, hoping
for the best, and judging everyone with
charity.</p>

<p>The thing that vexed them most (for
always there must, of course, be something)
was the behaviour of Albert, nephew to the
baron, and most loving cousin of Frida.
Nothing they could do might bring him to
spend his Christmas with them; and this
would be the first time ever since his long-clothed
babyhood that he had failed to be
among them, and to lead or follow, just as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
might be required of him. Such a guest
has no small value in a lonely neighbourhood,
and years of usage mar the circle of
the year without him.</p>

<p>Christmas passed, and New Year’s Day,
and so did many other days. The baron
saw to his proper work, and took his turn
of hunting, and entertained his neighbours,
and pleased almost everybody. Much
against his will, he had consented to the
marriage of his daughter with Lord Auberley&mdash;to
make the best of a bad job, as he
told Sir Maunder Meddleby. Still, this
kind and crafty father had his own ideas;
for the moment he was swimming with the
tide to please his daughter, even as for her
dear sake he was ready to sink beneath
it. Yet, these fathers have a right to form
their own opinions; and for the most part
they believe that they have more experience.
Frida laughed at this, of course, and
her father was glad to see her laugh.
Nevertheless, he could not escape some
respect for his own opinion, having so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
rarely found it wrong; and his own opinion
was that something was very likely to
happen.</p>

<p>In this he proved to be quite right. For
many things began to happen, some on the
right and some on the left hand of the
baron’s auguries. All of them, however,
might be reconciled exactly with the very
thing he had predicted. He noticed this,
and it pleased him well, and inspired him so
that he started anew for even truer prophecies.
And everybody round the place was
born so to respect him that, if he missed
the mark a little, they could hit it for him.</p>

<p>Things stood thus at the old Ley Manor&mdash;and
folk were content to have them so, for
fear of getting worse, perhaps&mdash;toward the
end of January, <span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1643. De Wichehalse
had vowed that his only child&mdash;although
so clever for her age, and prompt of mind
and body&mdash;should not enter into marriage
until she was in her eighteenth year. Otherwise,
it would, no doubt, have all been
settled long ago; for Aubyn Auberley<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
sometimes had been in the greatest hurry.
However, hither he must come now, as
everybody argued, even though the fate of
England hung on his stirrup-leather. Because
he had even sent again, with his very
best intentions, fashionable things for
Frida, and the hottest messages; so that,
if they did not mean him to be quite beside
himself, everything must be smoking for his
wedding at the Candlemas.</p>

<p>But when everything and even everybody
else&mdash;save Albert and the baron, and a few
other obstinate people&mdash;was and were quite
ready and rejoicing for a grand affair, to be
celebrated with well-springs of wine and
delightfully cordial Watersmeet, rocks of
beef hewn into valleys, and conglomerate
cliffs of pudding; when ruddy dame and
rosy damsel were absorbed in “what to
wear,” and even steady farmers were in
“practice for the back step”; in a word,
when all the country was gone wild about
Frida’s wedding&mdash;one night there happened
to come a man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
This man tied his horse to a gate and
sneaked into the back yard, and listened in
a quiet corner, knowing, as he did, the
ins and outs and ways of the kitchen.
Because he was that very same man who
understood the women so, and made himself
at home, by long experience, in new
places. It had befallen this man, as it
always befell any man of perception, to be
smitten with the kindly loveliness of Frida.
Therefore, now, although he was as hungry
as ever he had been, his heart was such that
he heard the sound of dishes, yet drew no
nearer. Experience of human nature does
not always spoil it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
</div>

<p>When the baron at last received the letter
which this rider had been so abashed to
deliver, slow but lasting wrath began to
gather in his gray-lashed eyes. It was the
inborn anger of an honest man at villany
mixed with lofty scorn and traversed by a
dear anxiety. Withal he found himself so
helpless that he scarce knew what to do.
He had been to Frida both a father and a
mother, as she often used to tell him when
she wanted something; but now he felt that
no man could administer the velvet touches
of the female sympathy.</p>

<p>Moreover, although he was so kind, and
had tried to think what his daughter thought,
he found himself in a most ungenial mood
for sweet condolement. Any but the best
of fathers would have been delighted with
the proof of all his prophecies and the riddance
of a rogue. So that even he, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
dwelling in his child’s heart as his own,
read this letter (when the first emotions had
exploded) with a real hope that things, in
the long run, would come round again.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“To my most esteemed and honoured
friend, the Lord de Wichehalse, these from
his most observant and most grateful Aubyn
Auberley,&mdash;Under command of his Majesty,
our most Royal Lord and King, I have this
day been joined in bands of holy marriage
with her Highness, the Duchess of B&mdash;&mdash;,
in France. At one time I had hope of
favour with your good Lordship’s daughter,
neither could I have desired more complete
promotion. But the service of the kingdom
and the doubt of my own desert have
forced me, in these troublous times, to
forego mine own ambition. Our lord the
King enjoins you with his Royal commendation,
to bring your forces toward Bristowe
by the day of St. Valentine. There shall I
be in hope to meet your Lordship, and
again find pleasure in such goodly company.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Until then I am your Lordship’s
poor and humble servant,</p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">Aubyn Auberley</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Lord de Wichehalse made his mind up
not to let his daughter know until the following
morning what a heavy blow had
fallen on her faith and fealty. But, as evil
chance would have it, the damsels of the
house&mdash;and most of all the gentle cook-maid&mdash;could
not but observe the rider’s
state of mind toward them. He managed
to eat his supper in a dark state of parenthesis;
but after that they plied him with
some sentimental mixtures, and, being only
a man at best, although a very trusty one,
he could not help the rise of manly wrath at
every tumbler. So, in spite of dry experience
and careworn discretion, at last he let
the woman know the whole of what himself
knew. Nine good females crowded round
him, and, of course, in their kind bosoms
every word of all his story germinated
ninety-fold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Hence it came to pass that, after floods
of tears in council and stronger language
than had right to come from under aprons,
Frida’s nurse (the old herb-woman, now
called “Mother Eyebright”) was appointed
to let her know that very night the whole
of it. Because my lord might go on mooning
for a month about it, betwixt his love
of his daughter and his quiet way of taking
things; and all that while the dresses might
be cut, and trimmed, and fitted to a size
and fashion all gone by before there came a
wedding.</p>

<p>Mother Eyebright so was called both
from the brightness of her eyes and her
faith in that little simple flower, the euphrasia.
Though her own love-tide was over,
and the romance of life had long relapsed
into the old allegiance to the hour of
dinner, yet her heart was not grown tough
to the troubles of the young ones; therefore
all that she could do was done, but it
was little.</p>

<p>Frida, being almost tired with the blissful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
cares of dress, happened to go up that
evening earlier than her wont to bed. She
sat by herself in the firelight, with many
gorgeous things around her&mdash;wedding
presents from great people, and (what
touched her more) the humble offerings of
her cottage friends. As she looked on
these and thought of all the good will they
expressed, and how a little kindness gathers
such a heap of gratitude, glad tears shone
in her bright eyes, and she only wished
that all the world could be as blessed as
she was.</p>

<p>To her entered Mother Eyebright, now
unworthy of her name; and sobbing, writhing,
crushing anguish is a thing which even
Frida, simple and open-hearted one, would
rather keep to her own poor self.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>
</div>

<p>Upon the following day she was not half
so wretched and lamentable as was expected
of her. She even showed a brisk
and pleasant air to the chief seamstress,
and bade her keep some pretty things for
the time of her own wedding. Even to her
father she behaved as if there had been
nothing more than happens every day.
The worthy baron went to fold her in his
arms, and let her cry there; but she only
gave him a kiss, and asked the maid for
some salt butter. Lord de Wichehalse,
being disappointed of his outlet, thought
(as all his life he had been forced to think
continually) that any sort of woman,
whether young or old, is wonderful. And
so she carried on, and no one well could
understand her.</p>

<p>She, however, in her own heart, knew the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
ups and downs of it. She alone could feel
the want of any faith remaining, the ache
of ever stretching forth and laying hold on
nothing. Her mind had never been encouraged&mdash;as
with maidens nowadays&mdash;to
magnify itself, and soar, and scorn the
heart that victuals it. All the deeper was
her trouble, being less to be explained.</p>

<p>For a day or two the story is that she
contrived to keep her distance, and her own
opinion of what had been done to her.
Child and almost baby as her father had
considered her, even he was awed from
asking what she meant to do about it.
Something seemed to keep her back from
speaking of her trouble, or bearing to have
it spoken of. Only to her faithful hound,
with whom she now began again to wander
in the oak-wood, to him alone had she the
comfort of declaring anything. This was
a dog of fine old English breed and high
connections, his great-grandmother having
owned a kennel at Whitehall itself&mdash;a very
large and well-conducted dog, and now an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
old one, going down into his grave without
a stain upon him. Only he had shown such
foul contempt of Aubyn Auberley, proceeding
to extremes of ill-behaviour toward his
raiment, that for months young Frida had
been forced to keep him chained, and take
her favourite walks without him.</p>

<p>“Ah, Lear!” now she cried, with sense
of long injustice toward him; “you were
right, and I was wrong; at least&mdash;at least
it seems so.”</p>

<p>“Lear,” so called whether by some man
who had heard of Shakspere, or (as seems
more likely) from his peculiar way of contemplating
the world at his own angle,
shook his ears when thus addressed, and
looked too wise for any dog to even sniff
his wisdom.</p>

<p>Frida now allowed this dog to lead the
way, and she would follow, careless of
whatever mischief might be in the road for
them. So he led her, without care or even
thought on her part, to a hut upon the
beach of Woody Bay; where Albert had set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
up his staff, to think of her and watch her.
This, her cousin and true lover, had been
grieving for her sorrow to the utmost power
of a man who wanted her himself. It may
have been beyond his power to help saying
to himself sometimes, “How this serves
her right, for making such a laughing-stock
of me!” Nevertheless, he did his utmost
to be truly sorrowful.</p>

<p>And now, as he came forth to meet her,
in his fishing dress and boots (as different
a figure as could be from Aubyn Auberley),
memories of childish troubles and of strong
protection thrilled her with a helpless hope
of something to be done for her. So she
looked at him, and let him see the state her
eyes were in with constant crying, when
there was not anyone to notice it. Also,
she allowed him to be certain what her
hands were like, and to be surprised how
much she had fallen away in her figure.
Neither was she quite as proud as might
have been expected, to keep her voice
from trembling or her plundered heart from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
sobbing. Only, let not anybody say a word
to comfort her. Anything but that she now
could bear, as she bore everything. It was,
of course, the proper thing for everyone to
scorn her. That, of course, she had fully
earned, and met it, therefore, with disdain.
Only, she could almost hate anybody who
tried to comfort her.</p>

<p>Albert de Wichehalse, with a sudden
start of intuition, saw what her father had
been unable to descry or even dream. The
worthy baron’s time of life for fervid
thoughts was over; for him despairing love
was but a poet’s fiction, or a joke against a
pale young lady. But Albert felt from his
own case, from burning jealousy suppressed,
and cold neglect put up with, and all the
other many-pointed aches of vain devotion,
how sad must be the state of things when
plighted faith was shattered also, and great
ridicule left behind, with only a young girl
to face it, motherless, and having none to
stroke dishevelled hair, and coax the troubles
by the firelight. However, this good fellow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
did the utmost he could do for her.
Love and pity led him into dainty loving
kindness; and when he could not find his
way to say the right thing, he did better&mdash;he
left her to say it. And so well did he
move her courage, in his old protective
way, without a word that could offend her
or depreciate her love, that she for the moment,
like a woman, wondered at her own
despair. Also, like a woman, glancing into
this and that, instead of any steadfast gazing,
she had wholesome change of view,
winning sudden insight into Albert’s
thoughts concerning her. Of course, she
made up her mind at once, although her
heart was aching so for want of any tenant,
in a moment to extinguish any such presumption.
Still, she would have liked to
have it made a little clearer, if it were for
nothing else than to be sure of something.</p>

<p>Albert saw her safely climb the steep and
shaly walk that led, among retentive oak
trees, or around the naked gully, all the
way from his lonely cottage to the light,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
and warmth, and comfort of the peopled
Manor House. And within himself he
thought, the more from contrast of his own
cold comfort and untended state:</p>

<p>“Ah! she will forget it soon; she is so
young. She will soon get over that gay
frippard’s fickleness. To-morrow I will
start upon my little errand cheerfully.
After that she will come round; they cannot
feel as we do.”</p>

<p>Full of these fond hopes, he started on
the following morning with set purpose to
compel the man whom he had once disliked,
and now despised unspeakably, to render
some account of despite done to such a
family. For, after all, the dainty viscount
was the grandson of a goldsmith, who by
brokerage for the Crown had earned the
balls of his coronet. In quest of this gay
fellow went the stern and solid Albert,
leaving not a word about his purpose there
behind him, but allowing everybody to believe
what all found out. All found out, as
he expected, that he was gone to sell his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
hay, perhaps as far as Taunton; and all the
parish, looking forward to great rise of
forage, felt indignant that he had not
doubled his price, and let them think.</p>

<p>Alack-a-day and all the year round! that
men perceive not how the women differ
from them in the very source of thought.
Albert never dreamed that his cousin, after
doing so long without him, had now relapsed
quite suddenly into her childish dependence
upon him. And when she heard, on the following
day, that he was gone for the lofty
purpose of selling his seven ricks of hay,
she said not a word, but only felt her cold
heart so much colder.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
</div>

<p>She had nothing now to do, and nobody
to speak to; though her father did his
utmost, in his kind and clumsy way, to
draw his darling close to him. But she
knew that all along he had disliked her idol,
and she fancied, now and then, that this dislike
had had something perhaps to do with
what had befallen her. This, of course,
was wrong on her part. But when youth
and faith are wronged, the hurt is very apt
to fly to all the tender places. Even the
weather also seemed to have taken a turn
against her. No wholesome frost set in to
brace the slackened joints and make her
walk until she began to tingle; neither
was there any snow to spread a new cast
on the rocks and gift the trees with airiness;
nor even what mild winters, for the
most part, bring in counterpoise&mdash;soft,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
obedient skies, and trembling pleasure of
the air and earth. But&mdash;as over her own
love&mdash;over all the country hung just
enough of mist and chill to shut out cheerful
prospect, and not enough to shut folk
in to the hearth of their own comfort.</p>

<p>In her dull, forlorn condition, Frida still,
through force of habit or the love of solitude,
made her daily round of wood and
rock, seashore and moorland. Things
seemed to come across her now, instead of
her going to them, and her spirit failed
at every rise of the hilly road against her.
In that dreary way she lingered, hoping
nothing, fearing nothing, showing neither
sigh nor tear, only seeking to go somewhere
and be lost from self and sorrow in
the cloudy and dark day.</p>

<p>Often thus the soft, low moaning of the
sea encompassed her, where she stood, in
forgotten beauty, careless of the wind and
wave. The short, uneasy heave of waters
in among the kelpy rocks, flowing from no
swell or furrow on the misty glass of sea,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
but like a pulse of discontent, and longing
to go further; after the turn, the little
rattle of invaded pebbles, the lithe relapse
and soft, shampooing lambency of oarweed,
then the lavered boulders pouring gritty
runnels back again, and every basined outlet
wavering toward another inlet; these,
and every phase of each innumerable to-and-fro,
made or met their impress in her
fluctuating misery.</p>

<p>“It is the only rest,” she said; “the
only chance of being quiet, after all that I
have done, and all that people say of me.”</p>

<p>None had been dastard enough to say a
syllable against her; neither had she, in
the warmest faith of love, forgotten truth;
but her own dejection drove her, not to
revile the world (as sour natures do consistently),
but to shrink from sight, and
fancy that the world was reviling her.</p>

<p>While she fluttered thus and hovered
over the cold verge of death, with her sore
distempered spirit, scarcely sure of anything,
tidings came of another trouble, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
turned the scale against her. Albert de
Wichehalse, her trusty cousin and true
lover, had fallen in a duel with that
recreant and miscreant Lord Auberley.
The strictest orders were given that this
should be kept for the present from Frida’s
ears; but what is the use of the strictest
orders when a widowed mother raves?
Albert’s mother vowed that “the shameless
jilt” should hear it out, and slipped
her guards and waylaid Frida on the morn
of Candlemas, and overbore her with such
words as may be well imagined.</p>

<p>“Auntie!” said the poor thing at last,
shaking her beautiful curls, and laying one
little hand to her empty heart, “don’t be
cross with me to-day. I am going home to
be married, auntie. It is the day my
Aubyn always fixed, and he never fails me.”</p>

<p>“Little fool!” her aunt exclaimed, as
Frida kissed her hand and courtesied, and
ran round the corner; “one comfort is to
know that she is as mad as a mole, at any
rate.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p>Frida, knowing&mdash;perhaps more deeply
than that violent woman thought&mdash;the mischief
thus put into her, stole back to her
bedroom, and, without a word to anyone,
tired her hair in the Grecian snood which
her lover used to admire so, and arrayed
her soft and delicate form in all the bridal
finery. Perhaps, that day, no bride in
England&mdash;certainly none of her youth and
beauty&mdash;treated her favourite looking-glass
with such contempt and ingratitude. She
did not care to examine herself, through
some reluctant sense of havoc, and a bitter
fear that someone might be disappointed
in her. Then at the last, when all was
ready, she snatched up her lover’s portrait
(which for days had been cast aside and
cold), and, laying it on her bosom, took a
snatch of a glance at her lovely self.</p>

<p>After some wonder she fetched a deep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
sigh&mdash;not from clearly thinking anything,
but as an act of nature&mdash;and said, “Good-by!”
forever, with a little smile of irony,
to her looking-glass, and all the many pretty
things that knew her.</p>

<p>It was her bad luck, as some people
thought thereafter&mdash;or her good luck, as
herself beheld it&mdash;to get down the stairs
and out of the house without anyone being
the wiser. For the widow De Wichehalse,
Albert’s mother, had not been content with
sealing the doom of this poor maiden, but
in that highly excited state, which was to
be expected, hurried into the house, to
beard the worthy baron in his den. There
she found him; and, although he said and
did all sympathy, the strain of parental feelings
could not yield without “hysterics.”</p>

<p>All the servants, and especially Mother
Eyebright (whose chief duty now was to
watch Frida), were called by the terrified
baron, and with one unanimous rush replied;
so that the daughter of the house left it
without notice, and before any glances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
was out of sight, in the rough ground where
the deer were feeding, and the umber oak-leaves
hung.</p>

<p>It was the dainty time when first the year
begins to have a little hope of meaning
kindly&mdash;when in the quiet places often, free
from any haste of wind, or hindrances
of pattering thaw, small and unimportant
flowers have a little knack of dreaming that
the world expects them. Therefore neither
do they wait for leaves to introduce them,
nor much weather to encourage, but in
shelfy corners come, in a day, or in a
night&mdash;no man knows quite which it is;
and there they are, as if by magic, asking,
“Am I welcome?” And if anybody sees
them, he is sure to answer “Yes.”</p>

<p>Frida, in the sheltered corners and the
sunny nooks of rock, saw a few of these
little things delicately trespassing upon the
petulance of spring. Also, though her
troubles wrapped her with an icy mantle,
softer breath of Nature came, and sighed
for her to listen to it, and to make the best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
of all that is not past the sighing. More
than once she stopped to listen, in the hush
of the timid south wind creeping through
the dishevelled wood; and once, but only
once, she was glad to see her first primrose
and last, and stooped to pluck, but, on
second thoughts, left it to outblossom her.</p>

<p>So, past many a briered rock, and dingle
buff with littered fern, green holly copse
where lurked the woodcock, and arcades of
zigzag oak, Frida kept her bridal robe from
spot, or rent, or blemish. Passing all these
little pleadings of the life she had always
loved, at last she turned the craggy corner
into the ledge of the windy cliff.</p>

<p>Now below her there was nothing but
repose from shallow thought; rest from all
the little troubles she had made so much
of; deep, eternal satisfaction in the arms of
something vast. But all the same, she did
not feel quite ready for the great jump yet.</p>

<p>The tide was in, and she must wait at
least until it began to turn, otherwise her
white satin velvet would have all its pile set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
wrong, if ever anybody found her. There
could be no worse luck than that for any
bride on her wedding-day; therefore up the
rock-walk Frida kept very close to the landward
side.</p>

<p>All this way she thought of pretty little
things said to her in the early days of love.
Many things that made her smile because
they had gone so otherwise, and one or two
that would have fetched her tears, if she
had any. Filled with vain remembrance
thus, and counting up the many presents
sent to her for this occasion, but remaining
safe at home, Frida came to the little
coving bower just inside the Point, where
she could go no further. Here she had
received the pledges, and the plight, and
honour; and here her light head led her on
to look for something faithful.</p>

<p>“When the tide turns I shall know it.
If he does not come by that time, there will
be no more to do. It will be too late for
weddings, for the tide turns at twelve
o’clock. How calm and peaceful is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
sea! How happy are the sea gulls, and how
true to one another!”</p>

<p>She stood where, if she had cared for life,
it would have been certain death to stand,
so giddy was the height, and the rock
beneath her feet so slippery. The craggy
headland, Duty Point, well known to
every navigator of that rock-bound coast,
commands the Channel for many a league,
facing eastward the Castle Rock and
Countisbury Foreland, and westward Highveer
Point, across the secluded cove of
Leymouth. With one sheer fall of a hundred
fathoms the stern cliff meets the baffled
sea&mdash;or met it then, but now the level of the
tide is lowering. Air and sea were still and
quiet; the murmur of the multitudinous
wavelets could not climb the cliff; but loops
and curves of snowy braiding on the dark
gray water showed the set of tide and shift
of current in and out the buried rocks.</p>

<p>Standing in the void of fear, and gazing
into the deep of death, Frida loved the pair
of sea gulls hovering halfway between her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
and the soft gray sea. These good birds
had found a place well suited for their
nesting, and sweetly screamed to one
another that it was a contract. Frida
watched how proud they were, and how they
kept their strong wings sailing and their gray
backs flat and quivering, while with buoyant
bosom each made circles round the other.</p>

<p>As she watched, she saw the turning of
the tide below them. The streaky bends
of curdled water, lately true as fairy-rings,
stopped and wavered, and drew inward on
their flowing curves, and outward on the
side toward the ebb. Then the south
wind brought the distant toll of her father’s
turret-clock, striking noon with slow deliberation
and dead certainty.</p>

<p>Frida made one little turn toward her
bower behind the cliff, where the many
sweet words spoken drew her to this last of
hope. All was silent. There was no one.
Now was the time to go home at last.</p>

<p>Suddenly she felt a heavy drag upon her
velvet skirt. Ancient Lear had escaped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
from the chain she had put on him, and,
more trusty than mankind, was come to
keep his faith with her.</p>

<p>“You fine old dog, it is too late! The
clock has struck. The tide has turned.
There is no one left to care for me; and I
have ruined everyone. Good-by, you only
true one!”</p>

<p>Submissive as he always was, the ancient
dog lay down when touched, and drew his
grizzled eyelids meekly over his dim and
sunken eyes. Before he lifted them again
Frida was below the sea gulls, and beneath
the waves they fished.</p>

<p>Lear, with a puzzled sniff, arose and
shook his head, and peered, with his old
eyes full of wistful wonder, down the fearful
precipice. Seeing something, he made
his mind up, gave one long re-echoed howl,
then tossed his mane, like a tawny wave,
and followed down the death-leap.</p>

<p>Neither body was ever found; and the
whole of this might not have been known
so clearly as it is known, unless it had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
happened that Mother Eyebright, growing
uneasy, came round the corner just in time
to be too late. She, like a sensible woman,
never dreamed of jumping after them, but
ran home so fast that she could not walk
to church for three months afterward; and
when her breath came back was enabled to
tell tenfold of all she had seen.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>One of the strangest things in life is the
way in which we mortals take the great and
fatal blows of life.</p>

<p>For instance, the baron was suddenly
told, while waiting for Frida to sit beside
him, at his one o’clock dinner:</p>

<p>“Plaize, my lard, your lardship’s darter
hath a been and jumped off Duty Point.”</p>

<p>“What an undutiful thing to do!” was
the first thing Lord de Wichehalse said;
and those who knew no better thought that
this was how he took it.</p>

<p>Aubyn Auberley, however, took a different
measure of a broken-hearted father’s
strength. For the baron buckled on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
armour of a century ago, which had served
his grandsire through hard blows in foreign
battles, and, with a few of his trusty servants,
rode to join the Parliament. It happened
so that he could not make redress of
his ruined life until the middle of the summer.
Then, at last, his chance came to him,
and he did not waste it. Viscount Auberley,
who had so often slipped away and
laughed at him, was brought to bay beneath
a tree in the famous fight of Lansdowne.</p>

<p>The young man offered to hold parley,
but the old man had no words. His snowy
hair and rugged forehead, hard-set mouth
and lifted arm, were enough to show his
meaning. The gallant, being so skilled of
fence, thought to play with this old man as
he had with his daughter; but the Gueldres
ax cleft his curly head, and split what little
brain it takes to fool a trusting maiden.</p>

<p>So, in early life, deceiver and deceived
were quit of harm; and may ere now have
both found out whether it is better to
inflict the wrong or suffer it.</p>

<h2><a id="GEORGE"></a>GEORGE BOWRING.<br />

<span class="subhead">A TALE OF CADER IDRIS.</span></h2>
</div>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>When I was a young man, and full of
spirits, some forty years ago or more, I
lost my best and truest friend in a very
sad and mysterious way. The greater part
of my life has been darkened by this heavy
blow and loss, and the blame which I poured
upon myself for my own share in the matter.</p>

<p>George Bowring had been seven years
with me at the fine old school of Shrewsbury,
and trod on my heels from form to
form so closely that, when I became at last
the captain of the school, he was second to
me. I was his elder by half a year, and
“sapped” very hard, while he laboured
little; so that it will be plain at a glance,
although he never acknowledged it, that
he was the better endowed of the two with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
natural ability. At that time we of Salop
always expected to carry everything, so
far as pure scholarship was concerned, at
both the universities. But nowadays I am
grieved to see that schools of quite a
different stamp (such as Rugby and Harrow,
and even Marlborough, and worse of
all peddling Manchester) have been running
our boys hard, and sometimes almost
beating them. And how have they done
it? Why, by purchasing masters of our
prime rank and special style.</p>

<p>George and myself were at one time
likely, and pretty well relied upon, to keep
up the fame of Sabrina’s crown, and hold
our own at Oxford. But suddenly it so
fell out that both of us were cut short of
classics, and flung into this unclassic world.
In the course of our last half year at school
and when we were both taking final polish
to stand for Balliol scholarships, which we
were almost sure to win, as all the examiners
were Shrewsbury men,&mdash;not that they
would be partial to us, but because we knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
all their questions,&mdash;within a week, both
George and I were forced to leave the dear
old school, the grand old town, the lovely
Severn, and everything but one another.</p>

<p>He lost his father; I lost my uncle, a
gentleman in Derbyshire, who had well
provided my education; but, having a
family of his own, could not be expected
to leave me much. And he left me even
less than could, from his own point of view,
have been rational. It is true that he had
seven children; but still a man of £15,000
a year might have done, without injustice&mdash;or,
I might say, with better justice&mdash;something
more than to leave his nephew a sum
which, after much pushing about into divers
insecurities, fetched £72 10s. per annum.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I am truly grateful;
though, perhaps, at the time I had not
that knowledge of the world which enlarges
the grateful organs. It cannot
matter what my feelings were, and I never
was mercenary. All my sentiments at that
period ran in Greek senarii; and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
it would show how good and lofty boys
were in that ancient time, though now
they are only rude Solecists, if I were to
set these verses down&mdash;but, after much consideration,
I find it wiser to keep them in.</p>

<p>George Bowring’s father had some
appointment well up in the Treasury. He
seems to have been at some time knighted
for finding a manuscript of great value that
went in the end to the paper mills. How
he did it, or what it was, or whether he
ever did it at all, were questions for no
one to meddle with. People in those days
had larger minds than they ever seem to
exhibit now. The king might tap a man,
and say, “Rise, Sir Joseph,” and all the
journals of the age, or, at least, the next
day, would echo “Sir Joseph!” And
really he was worthy of it. A knight he
lived, and a knight he died; and his widow
found it such a comfort!</p>

<p>And now on his father’s sudden death,
George Bowring was left not so very well
off. Sir Joseph had lived, as a knight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
should do, in a free-handed, errant, and
chivalrous style; and what he left behind
him made it lucky that the title dropped.
George, however, was better placed, as
regards the world, than I was; but not so
very much as to make a difference between
us. Having always held together, and
being started in life together, we resolved to
face the world (as other people are always
called) side by side, and with a friendship
that should make us as good as one.</p>

<p>This, however, did not come out exactly
as it should have done. Many things arose
between us&mdash;such as diverse occupation,
different hours of work and food, and a
little split in the taste of trowsers, which,
of course, should not have been. He liked
the selvage down his legs, while I thought it
unartistic, and, going much into the graphic
line, I pressed my objections strongly.</p>

<p>But George, in the handsomest manner&mdash;as
now, looking back on the case, I acknowledge&mdash;waived
my objections, and insisted
as little as he could upon his own.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
And again we became as tolerant as any two
men, at all alike, can be of one another.</p>

<p>He, by some postern of influence, got into
some dry ditch of the Treasury, and there,
as in an old castle-moat, began to be at
home, and move, gently and after his seniors,
as the young ducks follow the old ones.
And at every waddle he got more money.</p>

<p>My fortune, however, was not so nice. I
had not Sir Joseph, of Treasury cellars, to
light me with his name and memory into a
snug cell of my own. I had nothing to look
to but courage, and youth, and education,
and three-quarters of a hundred pounds a
year, with some little change to give out of
it. Yet why should I have doubted? Now,
I wonder at my own misgivings; yet all of
them still return upon me, if I ever am persuaded
just to try Welsh rabbit. Enough,
that I got on at last, to such an extent that
the man at the dairy offered me half a year’s
milk for a sketch of a cow that had never
belonged to him.</p>

<p>George, meanwhile, having something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
better than a brush for a walking stick and
an easel to sit down upon, had taken unto
himself a wife&mdash;a lady as sweet and bright
as could be&mdash;by name Emily Atkinson. In
truth, she was such a charming person that
I myself, in a quiet way, had taken a very
great fancy to her before George Bowring
saw her; but as soon as I found what a
desperate state the heart of poor George was
reduced to, and came to remember that he
was fitted by money to marry, while I was
not, it appeared to me my true duty toward
the young lady and him, and even myself, to
withdraw from the field, and have nothing
to say if they set up their horses together.</p>

<p>So George married Emily, and could not
imagine why it was that I strove in vain
to appear as his “best man,” at the rails
where they do it.</p>

<p>For though I had ordered a blue coat
and buttons, and a cashmere waistcoat
(amber-coloured, with a braid of peonies),
yet at the last moment my courage failed
me, and I was caught with a shivering in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
the knees, which the doctor said was ague.
This and that shyness of dining at his house
(which I thought it expedient to adopt during
the years of his married life) created
some little reserve between us, though
hardly so bad as our first disagreement concerning
the stripe down the pantaloons.</p>

<p>However, before that dereliction I had
made my friend a wedding present, as was
right and proper&mdash;a present such as nothing
less than a glorious windfall could have
enabled me to buy. For while engaged,
some three years back, upon a grand historical
painting of “Cœur de Lion and
Saladin,” now to be seen&mdash;but let that pass;
posterity will always know where to find it&mdash;I
was harassed in mind perpetually concerning
the grain of the fur of a cat. To
the dashing young artists of the present
day this may seem a trifle; to them, no
doubt, a cat is a cat&mdash;or would be, if they
could make it one. Of course, there are
cats enough in London, and sometimes
even a few to spare; but I wanted a cat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
of peculiar order, and of a Saracenic cast.
I walked miles and miles; till at last I found
him residing in a very old-fashioned house
in the Polygon, at Somers Town. Here
was a genuine paradise of cats, carefully
ministered to and guarded by a maiden lady
of Portuguese birth and of advanced maturity.
Each of these nine cats possessed
his own stool&mdash;a mahogany stool, with a
velvet cushion, and his name embroidered
upon it in beautiful letters of gold. And
every day they sat round the fire to digest
their dinners, all nine of them, each on his
proper stool, some purring, some washing
their faces, and some blinking or nodding
drowsily. But I need not have spoken
of this, except that one of them was called
“Saladin.” He was the very cat I wanted.
I made his acquaintance in the area, and
followed it up on the knife-boy’s board.
And then I had the most happy privilege
of saving him from a tail-pipe. Thus my
entrance was secured into this feline Eden;
and the lady was so well pleased that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
gave me an order for nine full-length cat
portraits, at the handsome price of ten
guineas apiece. And not only this, but
at her demise&mdash;which followed, alas! too
speedily&mdash;she left me £150, as a proof of
her esteem and affection.</p>

<p>This sum I divided into three equal
parts&mdash;fifty pounds for a present for
George, another fifty for a duty to myself,
and the residue to be put by for any future
purposes. I knew that my friend had no
gold watch; neither, of course, did I possess
one. In those days a gold watch was
thought a good deal of, and made an impression
in society, as a three-hundred-guinea
ring does now. Barwise was then
considered the best watchmaker in London,
and perhaps in the world. So I went to
his shop, and chose two gold watches of
good size and substance&mdash;none of your
trumpery catchpenny things, the size of
a gilt pill trodden upon&mdash;at the price of
fifty guineas each. As I took the pair,
the foreman let me have them for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
hundred pounds, including also in that
figure a handsome gold key for each, of
exactly the same pattern, and a guard for
the fob of watered black-silk ribbon.</p>

<p>My reason for choosing these two
watches, out of a trayful of similar quality,
was perhaps a little whimsical&mdash;viz., that the
numbers they bore happened to be sequents.
Each had its number engraved on its white
enamel dial, in small but very clear figures,
placed a little above the central spindle; also
upon the extreme verge, at the nadir below
the seconds hand, the name of the maker,
“Barwise, London.” They were not what
are called “hunting watches,” but had
strong and very clear lunette glasses fixed
in rims of substantial gold. And their respective
numbers were 7777 and 7778.</p>

<p>Carrying these in wash-leather bags, I
gave George Bowring his choice of the two;
and he chose the one with four figures of
seven, making some little joke about it,
not good enough to repeat, nor even bad
enough to laugh at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
</div>

<p>For six years after this all went smoothly
with George Bowring and myself. We met
almost daily, although we did not lodge
together (as once we had done) nor spend
the evening hours together, because, of
course, he had now his home and family
rising around him. By the summer of 1832
he had three children, and was expecting a
fourth at no very distant time. His eldest
son was named after me, “Robert Bistre,”
for such is my name, which I have often
thought of changing. Not that the name is
at all a bad one, as among friends and relations,
but that, when I am addressed by
strangers, “Mr. Bistre” has a jingling
sound, suggestive of childish levity. “Sir
Robert Bistre,” however, would sound
uncommonly well; and (as some people
say) less eminent artists&mdash;but perhaps, after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
all, I am not so very old as to be in a
hurry.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1832&mdash;as elderly people
will call to mind, and the younger sort will
have heard or read&mdash;the cholera broke over
London like a bursting meteor. Such panic
had not been known, I believe, since the
time of the plague, in the reign of Charles
II., as painted (beyond any skill of the
brush) by the simple and wonderful pen of
Defoe. There had been in the interval
many seasons&mdash;or at least I am informed
so&mdash;of sickness more widely spread, and of
death more frequent, if not so sudden.
But now this new plague, attacking so
harshly a man’s most perceptive and valued
part, drove rich people out of London
faster than horses (not being attacked)
could fly. Well, used as I was to a good
deal of poison in dealing with my colours, I
felt no alarm on my own account, but was
anxious about my landlady. This was an
excellently honest woman of fifty-five summers
at the utmost, but weakly confessing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
to as much as forty. She had made a point
of insisting upon a brisket of beef and a flat-polled
cabbage for dinner every Saturday;
and the same, with a “cowcumber,” cold on
Sunday; and for supper a soft-roed herring,
ever since her widowhood.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Whitehead,” said I&mdash;for that was
her name, though she said she did not
deserve it; and her hair confirmed her in
that position by growing darker from year
to year&mdash;“Madam, allow me to beg you to
vary your diet a little at this sad time.”</p>

<p>“I varies it every day, Mr. Bistre,” she
answered somewhat snappishly. “The
days of the week is not so many but what
they all come round again.”</p>

<p>For the moment I did not quite perceive
the precision of her argument; but after
her death I was able to do more justice to
her intellect. And, unhappily, she was removed
to a better world on the following
Sunday.</p>

<p>To a man in London of quiet habits and
regular ways and periods there scarcely can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
be a more desperate blow than the loss of
his landlady. It is not only that his conscience
pricks him for all his narrow,
plagiaristic, and even irrational suspicions
about the low level of his tea caddy, or a
neap tide in his brandy bottle, or any false
evidence of the eyes (which ever go spying
to lock up the heart), or the ears, which are
also wicked organs&mdash;these memories truly
are grievous to him, and make him yearn
now to be robbed again; but what he feels
most sadly is the desolation of having
nobody who understands his locks. One of
the best men I ever knew was so plagued
with his sideboard every day for two years,
after dinner, that he married a little new
maid-of-all-work&mdash;because she was a blacksmith’s
daughter.</p>

<p>Nothing of that sort, however, occurred
in my case, I am proud to say. But finding
myself in a helpless state, without anyone
to be afraid of, I had only two courses
before me: either to go back to my former
landlady (who was almost too much of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Tartar, perhaps), or else to run away from
my rooms till Providence provided a new
landlady.</p>

<p>Now, in this dilemma I met George
Bowring, who saw my distress, and most
kindly pressed me to stay at his house till
some female arose to manage my affairs
for me. This, of course, I declined to do,
especially under present circumstances; and,
with mutual pity, we parted. But the very
next day he sought me out, in a quiet nook
where a few good artists were accustomed to
meet and think; and there he told me that
really now he saw his way to cut short my
troubles as well as his own, and to earn a
piece of enjoyment and profit for both of us.
And I happen to remember his very words.</p>

<p>“You are cramped in your hand, my dear
fellow,” said he (for in those days youths
did not call each other “old man”&mdash;with
sad sense of their own decrepitude).
“Bob, you are losing your freedom of
touch. You must come out of these stony
holes, and look at a rocky mountain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
My heart gave a jump at these words;
and yet I had been too much laid flat by
facts&mdash;“sat upon,” is the slang of these
last twenty years, and in the present dearth
of invention must serve, no doubt, for
another twenty&mdash;I say that I had been used
as a cushion by so many landladies and
maids-of-all-work (who take not an hour to
find out where they need do no work), that
I could not fetch my breath to think of
ever going up a mountain.</p>

<p>“I will leave you to think of it, Bob,”
said George, putting his hat on carefully;
“I am bound for time, and you seem to
be nervous. Consult your pillow, my dear
fellow; and peep into your old stocking
and see whether you can afford it.”</p>

<p>That last hit settled me. People said, in
spite of all my generous acts&mdash;and nobody
knows, except myself, the frequency and
the extent of these&mdash;without understanding
the merits of the case&mdash;perfect (or rather
imperfect) strangers said that I was stingy!
To prove the contrary, I resolved to launch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
into great expenditure, and to pay coach
fare all the way from London toward the
nearest mountain.</p>

<p>Half the inhabitants now were rushing
helter-skelter out of London, and very often
to seaside towns where the smell of fish
destroyed them. And those who could not
get away were shuddering at the blinds
drawn down, and huddling away from the
mutes at the doors, and turning pale at the
funeral bells. And some, who had never
thought twice before of their latter end,
now began to dwell with so much unction
upon it, that Providence graciously spared
them the waste of perpetual preparation.</p>

<p>Among the rest, George Bowring had
been scared, far more than he liked to own,
by the sudden death of his butcher, between
half a dozen chops for cutlets and the trimming
of a wing-bone. George’s own cook
had gone down with the order, and meant
to bring it all back herself, because she
knew what butchers do when left to consider
their subject. And Mrs. Tompkins<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
was so alarmed that she gave only six
hours’ notice to leave, though her husband
was far on the salt-sea wave, according to
her own account, and she had none to make
her welcome except her father’s second
wife. This broke up the household; and
hence it was that George tempted me so
with the mountains.</p>

<p>For he took his wife and children to an
old manor-house in Berkshire, belonging
to two maiden aunts of the lady, who
promised to see to all that might happen,
but wanted no gentleman in the house at a
period of such delicacy. George Bowring,
therefore, agreed to meet me on the 12th
day of September, at the inn in Reading&mdash;I
forget its name&mdash;where the Regulator
coach (belonging to the old company, and
leaving White Horse Cellars at half-past
nine in the morning) allowed an hour to
dine, from one o’clock onward, as the roads
might be. And here I found him, and we
supped at Oxford, and did very well at the
Mitre. On the following morning we took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
coach for Shrewsbury, as we had agreed,
and, reaching the town before dark, put up
at the Talbot Inn, and sauntered into the
dear old school, to see what the lads had
been at since our time; for their names
and their exploits, at Oxford and Cambridge,
are scored in large letters upon the
panels, from the year 1806 and onward, so
that soon there will be no place to register
any more of them; and we found that
though we ourselves had done nothing,
many fine fellows had been instituted in
letters of higher humanity, and were holding
up the old standard, so that we longed
to invite them to dinner. But discipline
must be maintained; and that word means,
more than anything else, the difference of
men’s ages.</p>

<p>Now, at Shrewsbury, we had resolved to
cast off all further heed of coaches; and
knowing the country pretty well, or recalling
it from our childhood, to strike away
on foot for some of the mountain wildernesses.
Of these, in those days, nobody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
knew much more than that they were high
and steep, and slippery and dangerous, and
much to be shunned by all sensible people
who liked a nice fire and the right side of
the window. So that when we shouldered
staves with knapsacks flapping heavily, all
the wiser sort looked on us as marching off
to Bedlam.</p>

<p>In the morning, as we were starting, we
set our watches by the old school dial, as I
have cause to remember well. And we
staked half a crown, in a sporting manner,
each on his own watch to be the truer by
sun upon our way back again. And thus
we left those ancient walls and the glancing
of the river, and stoutly took the
Welshpool road, dreading nought except
starvation.</p>

<p>Although in those days I was not by any
means a cripple, George was far stronger
of arm and leg, having always been famous,
though we made no fuss about such things
then, for running and jumping, and lifting
weights, and using the boxing-gloves and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
the foils. A fine, brave fellow as ever lived,
with a short, straight nose and a resolute
chin, he touched the measuring-bar quite
fairly at seventy-four inches, and turned
the scales at fourteen stone and a quarter.
And so, as my chattels weighed more than
his (by means of a rough old easel and
material for rude sketches), he did me a
good turn now and then by changing packs
for a mile or two. And thus we came in
four days’ march to Aber-Aydyr, a village
lying under Cader Idris.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
</div>

<p>If any place ever lay out of the world,
and was proud of itself for doing so, this
little village of Aber-Aydyr must have been
very near it. The village was built, as the
people expressed it, of thirty cottages, one
public-house, one shop universal, and two
chapels. The torrent of the Aydyr entered
with a roar of rapids, and at the lower end
departed in a thunder of cascades. The
natives were all so accustomed to live in the
thick of this watery uproar that, whenever
they left their beloved village to see the
inferior outer world, they found themselves
as deaf as posts till they came to a weir or a
waterfall. And they told us that in the
scorching summer of the year 1826 the
river had failed them so that for nearly a
month they could only discourse by signs;
and they used to stand on the bridge and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
point at the shrunken rapids, and stop their
ears to exclude that horrible emptiness.
Till a violent thunderstorm broke up the
drought, and the river came down roaring;
and the next day all Aber-Aydyr was able
to gossip again as usual.</p>

<p>Finding these people, who lived altogether
upon slate, of a quaint and original turn,
George Bowring and I resolved to halt and
rest the soles of our feet a little, and sketch
and fish the neighbourhood. For George
had brought his rod and tackle, and many
a time had he wanted to stop and set up his
rod and begin to cast; but I said that I
would not be cheated so: he had promised
me a mountain, and would he put me off
with a river? Here, however, we had both
delights; the river for him and the mountain
for me. As for the fishing, all that he
might have, and I would grudge him none
of it, if he fairly divided whatever he
caught. But he must not expect me to
follow him always and watch all his dainty
manœuvring; each was to carry and eat his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
own dinner, whenever we made a day of it,
so that he might keep to his flies and his
water, while I worked away with my brush
at the mountains. And thus we spent a
most pleasant week, though we knew very
little of Welsh and the slaters spoke but
little English. But&mdash;much as they are
maligned because they will not have
strangers to work with them&mdash;we found
them a thoroughly civil, obliging, and
rather intelligent set of men; most of them
also of a respectable and religious turn of
mind; and they scarcely ever poach, except
on Saturdays and Mondays.</p>

<p>On September 25, as we sat at breakfast
in the little sanded parlour of the Cross-Pipes
public house, our bedroom being
overhead, my dear friend complained to me
that he was tired of fishing so long up and
down one valley, and asked me to come
with him further up, into wilder and rockier
districts, where the water ran deeper (as he
had been told) and the trout were less
worried by quarrymen, because it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
such a savage place, deserted by all except
evil spirits, that even the Aber-Aydyr slaters
could not enjoy the fishing there. I promised
him gladly to come, only keeping the
old understanding between us, that each
should attend to his own pursuits and his
own opportunities mainly; so that George
might stir most when the trout rose well,
and I when the shadows fell properly. And
thus we set forth about nine o’clock of a
bright and cheerful morning, while the sun,
like a courtly perruquier of the reign of
George II., was lifting, and shifting, and
setting in order the vapoury curls of the
mountains.</p>

<p>We trudged along thus at a merry swing,
for the freshness of autumnal dew was
sparkling in the valley, until we came to
a rocky pass, where walking turned to
clambering. After an hour of sharpish
work among slaty shelves and threatening
crags, we got into one of those troughlike
hollows hung on each side with precipices,
which look as if the earth had sunk for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
sake of letting the water through. On our
left hand, cliff towered over cliff to the
grand height of Pen y Cader, the steepest
and most formidable aspect of the mountain.
Rock piled on rock, and shingle cast
in naked waste disdainfully, and slippery
channels scooped by torrents of tempestuous
waters, forbade one to desire at all to
have anything more to do with them&mdash;except,
of course, to get them painted at a
proper distance, so that they might hang
at last in the dining rooms of London, to
give people appetite with sense of hungry
breezes, and to make them comfortable
with the sight of danger.</p>

<p>“This is very grand indeed,” said
George, as he turned to watch me; for the
worst part of our business is to have
to give an opinion always upon points
of scenery. But I am glad that I was not
cross, or even crisp with him that day.</p>

<p>“It is magnificent,” I answered; “and I
see a piece of soft sward there, where you
can set up your rod, old fellow, while I get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
my sticks in trim. Let us fill our pipes and
watch the shadows; they do not fall quite
to suit me yet.”</p>

<p>“How these things make one think,”
cried Bowring, as we sat on a stone and
smoked, “of the miserable littleness of
men like you and me, Bob!”</p>

<p>“Speak for yourself, sir,” I said, laughing
at his unaccustomed, but by no means
novel, reflection. “I am quite contented
with my size, although I am smaller than
you, George. Dissatisfied mortal! Nature
wants no increase of us, or she would have
had it.”</p>

<p>“In another world we shall be much
larger,” he said, with his eyes on the tops
of the hills. “Last night I dreamed that
my wife and children were running to meet
me in heaven, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Tush! You go and catch fish,” I
replied; for tears were in his large, soft
eyes, and I hated the sentimental. “Would
they ever let such a little Turk as Bob
Bistre into heaven, do you think? My<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
godson would shout all the angels deaf and
outdrum all the cherubim.”</p>

<p>“Poor little chap! He is very noisy;
but he is not half a bad sort,” said George.
“If he only comes like his godfather I
shall wish no better luck for him.”</p>

<p>These were kind words, and I shook his
hand to let him know that I felt them; and
then, as if he were ashamed of having talked
rather weakly, he took with his strong legs
a dangerous leap of some ten or twelve feet
downward, and landed on a narrow ledge
that overhung the river. Here he put his
rod together, and I heard the click of reel
as he drew the loop at the end of the line
through the rings, and so on; and I heard
him cry “Chut!” as he took his flies from
his Scotch cap and found a tangle; and I
saw the glistening of his rod, as the sunshine
pierced the valley, and then his tall,
straight figure pass the corner of a crag
that stood as upright as a tombstone; and
after that no more of any live and bright
George Bowring.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
</div>

<p>Swift is the flight of Time whenever a
man would fain lay hold of him. All created
beings, from Behemoth to a butterfly, dread
and fly (as best they may) that universal
butcher&mdash;man. And as nothing is more
carefully killed by the upper sort of mankind
than Time, how can he help making off
for his life when anybody wants to catch
him?</p>

<p>Of course, I am not of that upper sort,
and make no pretence to be so; but Time,
perhaps, may be excused for thinking&mdash;having
had such a very short turn at my
clothes&mdash;that I belonged to the aristocracy.
At any rate, while I drew, and rubbed, and
dubbed, and made hieroglyphics, Time was
uneasily shifting and shuffling the lines
of the hills, as a fever patient jerks and
works the bed-clothes. And, worse than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
that, he was scurrying westward (frightened,
no doubt, by the equinox) at such a pace
that I was scared by the huddling together
of shadows. Awaking from a long, long
dream&mdash;through which I had been working
hard, and laying the foundations of a thousand
pounds hereafter&mdash;I felt the invisible
damp of evening settling in the valleys.
The sun, from over the sea, had still his
hand on Cader Idris; but every inferior
head and height was gray in the sweep of
his mantle.</p>

<p>I threw my hair back&mdash;for an artist
really should be picturesque; and, having
no other beauty, must be firm to long
hair, while it lasts&mdash;and then I shouted,
“George!” until the strata of the mountain
(which dip and jag, like veins of oak) began
and sluggishly prolonged a slow zigzag of
echoes. No counter-echo came to me; no
ring of any sonorous voice made crag, and
precipice, and mountain vocal with the
sound of “Bob!”</p>

<p>“He must have gone back. What a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
fool I must be never to remember seeing
him! He saw that I was full of rubbish,
and he would not disturb me. He is gone
back to the Cross-Pipes, no doubt. And
yet it does not seem like him.”</p>

<p>“To look for a pin in a bundle of hay”
would be a job of sense and wisdom rather
than to seek a thing so very small as a very
big man among the depth, and height, and
breadth of river, shingle, stone, and rock,
crag, precipice, and mountain. And so I
doubled up my things, while the very noise
they made in doubling flurried and alarmed
me; and I thought it was not like George
to leave me to find my way back all alone,
among the deep bogs, and the whirlpools,
and the trackless tracts of crag.</p>

<p>When I had got my fardel ready, and
was about to shoulder it, the sound of
brisk, short steps, set sharply upon doubtful
footing, struck my ear, through the roar
of the banks and stones that shook with
waterfall. And before I had time to ask,
“Who goes there?”&mdash;as in this solitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
one might do&mdash;a slight, short man, whom I
knew by sight as a workman of Aber-Aydyr,
named Evan Peters, was close to me, and
was swinging a slate-hammer in one hand,
and bore in the other a five-foot staff. He
seemed to be amazed at sight of me, but
touched his hat with his staff, and said:
“Good-night, gentleman!” in Welsh; for
the natives of this part are very polite.
“Good-night, Evan!” I answered, in his
own language, of which I had picked up a
little; and he looked well pleased, and said
in his English: “For why, sir, did you leave
your things in that place there? A bad
mans come and steal them, it is very
likely.”</p>

<p>Then he wished me “Good-night” again,
and was gone&mdash;for he seemed to be in a
dreadful hurry&mdash;before I had the sense to
ask him what he meant about “my things.”
But as his footfall died away a sudden fear
came over me.</p>

<p>“The things he meant must be George
Bowring’s,” I said to myself; and I dropped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
my own, and set off, with my blood all tingling,
for the place toward which he had
jerked his staff. How long it took me to
force my way among rugged rocks and
stubs of oak I cannot tell, for every
moment was an hour to me. But a streak
of sunset glanced along the lonesome gorge,
and cast my shadow further than my voice
would go; and by it I saw something long
and slender against a scar of rock, and
standing far in front of me. Toward this I
ran as fast as ever my trembling legs would
carry me, for I knew too well that it must
be the fishing-rod of George Bowring.</p>

<p>It was stuck in the ground&mdash;not carelessly,
nor even in any hurry; but as a
sportsman makes all snug, when for a time
he leaves off casting. For instance, the
end fly was fixed in the lowest ring of the
butt, and the slack of the line reeled up so
that the collar lay close to the rod itself.
Moreover, in such a rocky place, a bed to
receive the spike could not have been found
without some searching. For a moment I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
was reassured. Most likely George himself
was near&mdash;perhaps in quest of blueberries
(which abound at the foot of the shingles
and are a very delicious fruit), or of some
rare fern to send his wife, who was one of
the first in England to take much notice of
them. And it shows what confidence I had
in my friend’s activity and strength, that I
never feared the likely chance of his falling
from some precipice.</p>

<p>But just as I began, with some impatience&mdash;for
we were to have dined at the
Cross-Pipes about sundown, five good (or
very bad) miles away, and a brace of ducks
was the order&mdash;just as I began to shout,
“George! Wherever have you got to?”
leaping on a little rock, I saw a thing that
stopped me. At the further side of this
rock, and below my feet, was a fishing
basket, and a half-pint mug nearly full of
beer, and a crust of the brown, sweet bread
of the hills, and a young white onion, half
cut through, and a clasp-knife open, and a
screw of salt, and a slice of the cheese, just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
dashed with goat’s milk, which George was
so fond of, but I disliked; and there may
have been a hard-boiled egg. At the sight
of these things all my blood rushed to my
head in such a manner that all my power to
think was gone. I sat down on the rock
where George must have sat while beginning
his frugal luncheon, and I put my heels into
the marks of his, and, without knowing
why, I began to sob like a child who has
lost his mother. What train of reasoning
went through my brain&mdash;if any passed in
the obscurity&mdash;let metaphysicians or psychologists,
as they call themselves, pretend
to know. I only know that I kept on
whispering, “George is dead! Unless he
had been killed, he never would have left
his beer so!”</p>

<p>I must have sat, making a fool of myself,
a considerable time in this way, thinking of
George’s poor wife and children, and wondering
what would become of them, instead
of setting to work at once to know what
was become of him. I took up a piece of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
cheese-rind, showing a perfect impression
of his fine front teeth, and I put it in my
pocketbook, as the last thing he had
touched. And then I examined the place
all around and knelt to look for footmarks,
though the light was sadly waning.</p>

<p>For the moment I discovered nothing of
footsteps or other traces to frighten or to
comfort me. A little narrow channel (all
of rock and stone and slaty stuff) sloped to
the river’s brink, which was not more than
five yards distant. In this channel I saw
no mark except that some of the smaller
stones appeared to have been turned over;
and then I looked into the river itself, and
saw a force of water sliding smoothly into a
rocky pool.</p>

<p>“If he had fallen in there,” I said, “he
would have leaped out again in two
seconds; or even if the force of the water
had carried him down into that deep pool,
he can swim like a duck&mdash;of course he
can. What river could ever drown you,
George?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
And then I remembered how at Salop he
used to swim the flooded Severn when most
of us feared to approach the banks; and I
knew that he could not be drowned, unless
something first had stunned him. And
after that I looked around, and my heart
was full of terror.</p>

<p>“It is a murder!” I cried aloud, though
my voice among the rocks might well have
brought like fate upon me. “As sure as I
stand here, and God is looking down upon
me, this is a black murder!”</p>

<p>In what way I got back that night to
Aber-Aydyr I know not. All I remember
is that the people would not come out of
their houses to me, according to some
superstition, which was not explained till
morning; and, being unable to go to bed, I
took a blanket and lay down beneath a dry
arch of the bridge, and the Aydyr, as
swiftly as a spectre gliding, hushed me with
a melancholy song.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>
</div>

<p>Now, as sure as ever I lay beneath the
third arch of Aber-Aydyr Bridge, in a
blanket of Welsh serge or flannel, with a
double border, so surely did I see, and not
dream, what I am going to tell you.</p>

<p>The river ran from east to west; and the
moon, being now the harvest moon, was
not very high, but large and full, and just
gliding over the crest of the hill that overhangs
the quarry-pit; so that, if I can put
it plainly, the moon was across the river
from me, and striking the turbulent water
athwart, so that her face, or a glimmer
thereof, must have been lying upon the
river if any smooth place had been left
for it. But of this there was no chance,
because the whole of the river was in a
rush, according to its habit, and covered
with bubbles, and froth, and furrows, even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
where it did not splash, and spout, and
leap, as it loved to do. In the depth of the
night, when even the roar of the water
seemed drowsy and indolent, and the calm
trees stooped with their heavy limbs overhanging
the darkness languidly, and only a
few rays of the moon, like the fluttering of
a silver bird, moved in and out the mesh-work,
I leaned upon my elbow, and I saw
the dead George Bowring.</p>

<p>He came from the pit of the river toward
me, quietly and without stride or step,
gliding over the water like a mist or the
vapour of a calm white frost; and he stopped
at the ripple where the shore began, and he
looked at me very peacefully. And I felt
neither fear nor doubt of him, any more
than I do of this pen in my hand.</p>

<p>“George,” I said, “I have been uneasy
all the day about you and I cannot sleep,
and I have had no comfort. What has
made you treat me so?”</p>

<p>He seemed to be anxious to explain,
having always been so straightforward;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
but an unknown hand or the power of
death held him, so that he could only smile.
And then it appeared to me as if he pointed
to the water first and then to the sky, with
such an import that I understood (as
plainly as if he had pronounced it) that his
body lay under the one and his soul was
soaring on high through the other; and,
being forbidden to speak, he spread his
hands, as if entrusting me with all that had
belonged to him; and then he smiled once
more, and faded into the whiteness of the
froth and foam.</p>

<p>And then I knew that I had been holding
converse, face to face, with Death; and icy
fear shook me, and I strove in vain to hide
my eyes from everything. And when I
awoke in the morning there was a gray
trunk of an alder tree, just George Bowring’s
height and size, on the other side of
the water, so that I could have no doubt
that himself had been there.</p>

<p>After a search of about three hours we
found the body of my dear friend in a deep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
black pool of the Aydyr&mdash;not the first hole
below the place in which he sat down to his
luncheon, but nearly a hundred yards farther
down, where a bold cliff jutted out and
bent the water scornfully. Our quarrymen
would not search this pool until the sunlight
fell on it, because it was a place of
dread with a legend hovering over it. “The
Giant’s Tombstone” was the name of the
crag that overhung it; and the story was
that the giant Idris, when he grew worn out
with age, chose this rock out of many
others near the top of the mountain, and
laid it under his arm and came down here
to drink of the Aydyr. He drank the Aydyr
dry because he was feverish and flushed
with age; and he set down the crag in a hole
he had scooped with the palms of his hands
for more water; and then he lay down on
his back, and Death (who never could reach
to his knee when he stood) took advantage
of his posture to drive home the javelin.
And thus he lay dead, with the crag for his
headstone, and the weight of his corpse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
sank a grave for itself in the channel of the
river, and the toes of his boots are still to
be seen after less than a mile of the valley.</p>

<p>Under this headstone of Idris lay the
body of George Bowring, fair and comely,
with the clothes all perfect, and even the
light cap still on the head. And as we laid
it upon the grass, reverently and carefully,
the face, although it could smile no more,
still appeared to wear a smile, as if the new
world were its home, and death a mere
trouble left far behind. Even the eyes
were open, and their expression was not of
fright or pain, but pleasant and bright, with
a look of interest such as a man pays to his
food.</p>

<p>“Stand back, all of you!” I said sternly;
“none shall examine him but myself. Now
all of you note what I find here.”</p>

<p>I searched all his pockets, one after
another; and tears came to my eyes again as
I counted not less than eleven of them, for I
thought of the fuss we used to make with
the Shrewsbury tailor about them. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
was something in every pocket, but nothing
of any importance at present, except his
purse and a letter from his wife, for which
he had walked to Dolgelly and back on the
last entire day of his life.</p>

<p>“It is a hopeless mystery!” I exclaimed
aloud, as the Welshmen gazed with superstitious
awe and doubt. “He is dead as if
struck by lightning, but there was no storm
in the valley!”</p>

<p>“No, no, sure enough; no storm was
there. But it is plain to see what has
killed him!” This was Evan Peters, the
quarryman, and I glanced at him very suspiciously.
“Iss, sure, plain enough,” said
another; and then they all broke into Welsh,
with much gesticulation; and “e-ah, e-ah,”
and “otty, otty,” and “hanool, hanool,”
were the sounds they made&mdash;at least to an
ignorant English ear.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, you fools?” I
asked, being vexed at their offhand way of
settling things so far beyond them. “Can
you pretend to say what it was?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
“Indeed, then, and indeed, my gentleman,
it is no use to talk no more. It was
the Caroline Morgan.”</p>

<p>“Which is the nearest house?” I asked,
for I saw that some of them were already
girding up their loins to fly, at the mere
sound of that fearful name; for the cholera
morbus had scared the whole country; and
if one were to fly, all the rest would follow,
as swiftly as mountain sheep go. “Be
quick to the nearest house, my friends, and
we will send for the doctor.”</p>

<p>This was a lucky hit; for these Cambrians
never believed in anyone’s death
until he had “taken the doctor.” And so,
with much courage and kindness, “to give
the poor gentleman the last chance,” they
made a rude litter, and, bearing the body
upon sturdy shoulders, betook themselves
to a track which I had overlooked entirely.
Some people have all their wits about them
as soon as they are called for, but with me
it is mainly otherwise. And this I had
shown in two things already; the first of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
which came to my mind the moment I
pulled out my watch to see what the time
was. “Good Heavens!” it struck me,
“where is George’s watch? It was not in
any of his pockets; and I did not feel it in
his fob.”</p>

<p>In an instant I made them set down
the bier; and, much as it grieved me to
do such a thing, I carefully sought for my
dear friend’s watch. No watch, no seals,
no ribbon, was there! “Go on,” I said;
and I fell behind them, having much to
think about. In this condition, I took little
heed of the distance, or of the ground
itself; being even astonished when, at last,
we stopped; as if we were bound to go on
forever.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
</div>

<p>We had stopped at the gate of an old
farmhouse, built with massive boulder
stones, laid dry, and flushed in with mortar.
As dreary a place as was ever seen; at
the head of a narrow mountain-gorge, with
mountains towering over it. There was no
sign of life about it, except that a gaunt
hog trotted forth, and grunted at us, and
showed his tusks, and would perhaps have
charged us, if we had not been so many.
The house looked just like a low church-tower,
and might have been taken for one
at a distance if there had been any battlements.
It seemed to be four or five hundred
years old, and perhaps belonged to
some petty chief in the days of Owen Glendower.</p>

<p>“Knock again, Thomas Edwards. Stop,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
let me knock,” said one of our party
impatiently. “There, waddow, waddow,
waddow!”</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, he
thumped with a big stone heavily, till a
middle-aged woman, with rough black hair,
looked out of a window and screamed in
Welsh to ask what this terrible noise was.
To this they made answer in the same
language, pointing to their sad burden, and
asking permission to leave it for the doctor’s
inspection and the inquest, if there
was to be one. And I told them to add
that I would pay well&mdash;anything, whatever
she might like to ask. But she screamed
out something that sounded like a curse,
and closed the lattice violently. Knowing
that many superstitions lingered in these
mountains&mdash;as, indeed, they do elsewhere
plentifully&mdash;I was not surprised at the
woman’s stern refusal to admit us, especially
at this time of pest; but I thought it
strange that her fierce black eyes avoided
both me and the poor rude litter on which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
the body of George lay, covered with some
slate-workers’ aprons.</p>

<p>“She is not the mistress!” cried Evan
Peters, in great excitement, as I thought.
“Ask where is Hopkin&mdash;Black Hopkin&mdash;where
is he?”</p>

<p>At this suggestion a general outcry arose
in Welsh for “Black Hopkin”; an outcry
so loud and prolonged that the woman
opened the window again and screamed&mdash;as
they told me afterward&mdash;“He is not at
home, you noisy fools; he is gone to Machynlleth.
Not long would you dare to make
this noise if Hopkin ap Howel was at home.”</p>

<p>But while she was speaking the wicket-door
of the great arched gate was thrown
open, and a gun about six feet long and of
very large bore was presented at us. The
quarrymen drew aside briskly, and I was
about to move somewhat hastily, when the
great, swarthy man who was holding the
gun withdrew it, and lifted his hat to me,
proudly and as an equal.</p>

<p>“You cannot enter this house,” he said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
in very good English, and by no means
rudely. “I am sorry for it, but it cannot
be. My little daughter is very ill, the last
of seven. You must go elsewhere.”</p>

<p>With these words he bowed again to me,
while his sad eyes seemed to pierce my soul;
and then he quietly closed the wicket and
fastened it with a heavy bolt, and I knew
that we must indeed go further.</p>

<p>This was no easy thing to do; for our
useless walk to “Crug y Dlwlith” (the
Dewless Hills), as this farm was called,
had taken us further at every step from
the place we must strive for after all&mdash;the
good little Aber-Aydyr. The gallant
quarrymen were now growing both weary
and uneasy; and in justice to them I must
say that no temptation of money, nor even
any appeal to their sympathies, but only
a challenge of their patriotism held them
to the sad duties owing from the living to
the dead. But knowing how proud all
Welshmen are of the fame of their race and
country, happily I exclaimed at last, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
fear was getting the mastery, “What will
be said of this in England, this low cowardice
of the Cymro?” Upon that they
looked at one another and did their best
right gallantly.</p>

<p>Now, I need not go into any further sad
details of this most sad time, except to say
that Dr. Jones, who came the next day
from Dolgelly, made a brief examination
by order of the coroner. Of course, he
had too much sense to suppose that the
case was one of cholera; but to my surprise
he pronounced that death was the
result of “asphyxia, caused by too long
immersion in the water.” And knowing
nothing of George Bowring’s activity,
vigour, and cultivated power in the water,
perhaps he was not to be blamed for dreaming
that a little mountain stream could
drown him. I, on the other hand, felt as
sure that my dear friend was foully murdered
as I did that I should meet him in
heaven&mdash;if I lived well for the rest of my
life, which I resolved at once to do&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
there have the whole thing explained, and
perhaps be permitted to glance at the man
who did it, as Lazarus did at Dives.</p>

<p>In spite of the doctor’s evidence and the
coroner’s own persuasion, the jury found
that “George Bowring died of the Caroline
Morgan”&mdash;which the clerk corrected to
cholera morbus&mdash;“brought on by wetting
his feet and eating too many fish of his
own catching.” And so you may see it
entered now in the records of the court of
the coroners of the king for Merioneth.</p>

<p>And now I was occupied with a trouble,
which, after all, was more urgent than the
enquiry how it came to pass. When a man
is dead, it must be taken as a done thing,
not to be undone; and, happily, all near
relatives are inclined to see it in that light.
They are grieved, of course, and they put
on hatbands and give no dinner parties;
and they even think of their latter ends
more than they might have desired to do.
But after a little while all comes round.
Such things must be happening always,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
and it seems so unchristian to repine; and
if any money has been left them, truly
they must attend to it. On the other
hand, if there has been no money, they
scarcely see why they should mourn for
nothing; and, as a duty, they begin to
allow themselves to be roused up.</p>

<p>But when a wife becomes a widow, it
is wholly different. No money can ever
make up to her the utter loss of the love-time
and the loneliness of the remaining
years; the little turns, and thoughts, and
touches&mdash;wherever she goes and whatever
she does&mdash;which at every corner meet her
with a deep, perpetual want. She tries to
fetch her spirit up and to think of her
duties to all around&mdash;to her children, or
to the guests whom trouble forces upon
her for business’ sake, or even the friends
who call to comfort (though the call can
fetch her none); but all the while how
deeply aches her sense that all these duties
are as different as a thing can be from her
love-work to her husband!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
What could I do? I had heard from
George, but could not for my life remember,
the name of that old house in Berkshire
where poor Mrs. Bowring was on a
visit to two of her aunts, as I said before.
I ventured to open her letter to her husband,
found in his left-hand side breast-pocket,
and, having dried it, endeavoured
only to make out whence she wrote; but
there was nothing. Ladies scarcely ever
date a letter both with time and place, for
they seem to think that everybody must
know it, because they do. So the best
I could do was to write to poor George’s
house in London, and beg that the letter
might be forwarded at once. It came,
however, too late to hand. For, although
the newspapers of that time were respectably
slow and steady, compared with the
rush they all make nowadays, they generally
managed to outrun the post, especially
in the nutting season. They told me at
Dolgelly, and they confirmed it at Machynlleth,
that nobody must desire to get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
his letters at any particular time, in the
months of September and October, when
the nuts were ripe. For the postmen
never would come along until they had
filled their bags with nuts, for the pleasure
of their families. And I dare say they do
the same thing now, but without being free
to declare it so.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>
</div>

<p>The body of my dear friend was borne
round the mountain slopes to Dolgelly and
buried there, with no relative near, nor any
mourner except myself; for his wife, or
rather his widow, was taken with sudden
illness (as might be expected), and for
weeks it was doubtful whether she would
stay behind to mourn for him. But youth
and strength at last restored her to dreary
duties and worldly troubles.</p>

<p>Of the latter, a great part fell on me;
and I did my best&mdash;though you might not
think so, after the fuss I made of my own&mdash;to
intercept all that I could, and quit myself
manfully of the trust which George
had returned from the dead to enjoin.
And, what with one thing and another, and
a sudden dearth of money which fell on me
(when my cat-fund was all spent, and my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
gold watch gone up a gargoyle), I had such
a job to feed the living that I never was
able to follow up the dead.</p>

<p>The magistrates held some enquiry, of
course, and I had to give my evidence;
but nothing came of it, except that the
quarryman, Evan Peters, clearly proved his
innocence. Being a very clever fellow, and
dabbling a bit in geology, he had taken his
hammer up the mountains, as his practice
was when he could spare the time, to seek
for new veins of slate, or lead, or even
gold, which is said to be there. He was
able to show that he had been at Tal y
Llyn at the time of day when George would
be having his luncheon; and the people
who knew Evan Peters were much more
inclined to suspect me than him. But why
should they suspect anybody, when anyone
but a fool could see “how plain it was of
the cholera?”</p>

<p>Twenty years slipped by (like a rope paid
out on the seashore, “hand over hand,”
chafing as it goes, but gone as soon as one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
looks after it), and my hair was gray, and
my fame was growing (slowly, as it appeared
to me, but as all my friends said
“rapidly”; as if I could never have earned
it!) when the mystery of George Bowring’s
death was solved without an effort.</p>

<p>I had been so taken up with the three
dear children, and working for them as
hard as if they were my own (for the
treasury of our British empire was bankrupt
to these little ones&mdash;“no provision had
been made for such a case,” and so we had
to make it)&mdash;I say that these children had
grown to me and I to them in such degree
that they all of them called me “Uncle!”</p>

<p>This is the most endearing word that one
human being can use to another. A fellow
is certain to fight with his brothers and
sisters, his father, and perhaps even his
mother. Tenfold thus with his wife; but
whoever did fight with his uncle? Of
course I mean unless he was his heir. And
the tenderness of this relation has not
escaped <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vox populi</i>, that keen discriminator.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Who is the most reliable, cordial, indispensable
of mankind&mdash;especially to artists&mdash;in
every sense of the word the dearest? A
pawnbroker; he is our uncle.</p>

<p>Under my care, these three children grew
to be splendid “members of society.”
They used to come and kick over my easel
with legs that were quite Titanic; and I
could not scold them when I thought of
George. Bob Bistre, the eldest, was my
apprentice, and must become famous in
consequence; and when he was twenty-five
years old, and money became no object to
me (through the purchase by a great art
critic of the very worst picture I ever
painted; half of it, in fact, was Bob’s!), I
gave the boy choice of our autumn trip to
California, or the antipodes.</p>

<p>“I would rather go to North Wales, dear
uncle,” he answered, and then dropped his
eyes, as his father used when he had provoked
me. That settled the matter. He
must have his way; though as for myself, I
must confess that I have begun, for a long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
time now, upon principle, to shun melancholy.</p>

<p>The whole of the district is opened up so
by those desperate railways that we positively
dined at the Cross-Pipes Hotel the
very day after we left Euston Square. Our
landlady did not remember me, which was
anything but flattering. But she jumped at
Bob as if she would have kissed him; for
he was the image of his father, whose handsome
face had charmed her.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
</div>

<p>The Aydyr was making as much noise as
ever, for the summer had been a wet one;
and of course all the people of Aber-Aydyr
had their ears wide open. I showed Bob
the bridge and the place of my vision, but
did not explain its meaning, lest my love
for him should seem fiduciary; and the
next morning, at his most urgent request,
we started afoot for that dark, sad valley.
It was a long walk, and I did not find that
twenty years had shortened it.</p>

<p>“Here we are at last,” I said, “and the
place looks the same as ever. There is the
grand old Pen y Cader, with the white
cloud rolling as usual; to the left and right
are the two other summits, the arms of the
chair of Idris; and over the shoulder of
that crag you can catch a glassy light in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
the air&mdash;that is the reflection of Tal y
Llyn.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” he answered impatiently.
“I know all that from your picture, uncle.
But show me the place where my father
died.”</p>

<p>“It lies immediately under our feet.
You see that gray stone down in the hollow,
a few yards from the river brink.
There he sat, as I have often told you,
twenty years ago this day. There he was
taking his food, when someone&mdash;&mdash;Well,
well! God knows, but we never shall. My
boy, I am stiff in the knees; go on.”</p>

<p>He went on alone, as I wished him to do,
with exactly his father’s step, and glance,
figure, face, and stature. Even his dress
was of the silver-gray which his father had
been so fond of, and which the kind young
fellow chose to please his widowed mother.
I could almost believe (as a cloudy mantle
stole in long folds over the highland, reproducing
the lights, and shades, and gloom
of that mysterious day) that the twenty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
years were all a dream, and that here was
poor George Bowring going to his murder
and his watery grave.</p>

<p>My nerves are good and strong, I trow;
and that much must have long been evident.
But I did not know what young Bob’s
might be, and therefore I left him to himself.
No man should be watched as he
stands at the grave of his wife or mother:
neither should a young fellow who sits on
the spot where his father was murdered.
Therefore, as soon as our Bob had descended
into the gray stone-pit, in which
his dear father must have breathed his
last, I took good care to be out of
sight, after observing that he sat down
exactly as his father must have sat, except
that his attitude, of course, was sad, and
his face pale and reproachful. Then, leaving
the poor young fellow to his thoughts,
I also sat down to collect myself.</p>

<p>But before I had time to do more than
wonder at the mysterious ways of the
world, or of Providence in guiding it; at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
the manner in which great wrong lies hidden,
and great woe falls unrecompensed;
at the dark, uncertain laws which cover
(like an indiscriminate mountain cloud) the
good and the bad, the kind and the cruel,
the murdered and the murderer&mdash;a loud
shriek rang through the rocky ravine, and
up the dark folds of the mountain.</p>

<p>I started with terror, and rushed forward,
and heard myself called, and saw
young Bowring leap up, and stand erect and
firm, although with a gesture of horror. At
his feet lay the body of a man struck dead,
flung on its back, with great hands spread
on the eyes, and white hair over them.</p>

<p>No need to ask what it meant. At last
the justice of God was manifest. The
murderer lay, a rigid corpse, before the
son of the murdered.</p>

<p>“Did you strike him?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Is it likely,” said the youth, “that I
would strike an aged man like that? I assure
you I never had such a fright in my
life. This poor old fellow came on me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
quite suddenly, from behind a rock, when
all my mind was full of my father; and his
eyes met mine, and down he fell, as if I
had shot him through the heart!”</p>

<p>“You have done no less,” I answered;
and then I stooped over the corpse (as I
had stooped over the corpse of its victim),
and the whole of my strength was required
to draw the great knotted hands from the
eyes, upon which they were cramped with
a spasm not yet relaxed.</p>

<p>“It is Hopkin ap Howel!” I cried,
as the great eyes, glaring with the horror
of death, stood forth. “Black Hopkin
once, white Hopkin now! Robert Bowring,
you have slain the man who slew your
father.”</p>

<p>“You know that I never meant to do it,”
said Bob. “Surely, uncle, it was his own
fault!”</p>

<p>“How did he come? I see no way.
He was not here when I showed you the
place, or else we must have seen him.”</p>

<p>“He came round the corner of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
rock, that stands in front of the furze-bush.”</p>

<p>Now that we had the clue, a little examination
showed the track. Behind the
furze-bush, a natural tunnel of rock, not
more than a few yards long, led into a narrow
gorge covered with brushwood, and
winding into the valley below the farmhouse
of the Dewless Crags. Thither we
hurried to obtain assistance, and there the
whole mystery was explained.</p>

<p>Black Hopkin (who stole behind George
Bowring and stunned, or, perhaps, slew him
with one vile blow) has this and this only to
say at the Bar&mdash;that he did it through love
of his daughter.</p>

<p>Gwenthlian, the last of seven, lay dying
on the day when my friend and myself
came up the valley of the Aydyr. Her
father, a man of enormous power of will
and passion, as well as muscle, rushed forth
of the house like a madman, when the doctor
from Dolgelly told him that nothing
more remained except to await the good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
time of heaven. It was the same deadly
decline which had slain every one of his
children at that same age, and now must
extinguish a long descended and slowly
impoverished family.</p>

<p>“If I had but a gold watch I could save
her!” he cried in his agony, as he left the
house. “Ever since the old gold watch
was sold, they have died&mdash;they have died!
They are gone, one after one, the last of all
my children!”</p>

<p>In these lonely valleys lurks a strange old
superstition that even Death must listen to
the voice of Time in gold; that, when the
scanty numbered moments of the sick are
fleeting, a gold watch laid in the wasted
palm, and pointing the earthly hours, compels
the scythe of Death to pause, the timeless
power to bow before the two great
gods of the human race&mdash;time and gold.</p>

<p>Poor George in the valley must have
shown his watch. The despairing father
must have been struck with crafty madness
at the sight. The watch was placed in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
daughter’s palm; but Death had no regard
for it. Thenceforth Black Hopkin was a
blasted man, racked with remorse and
heart-disease, sometimes raving, always
roving, but finding no place of repentance.
And it must have been a happy stroke&mdash;if
he had made his peace above, which none
of us can deal with&mdash;when the throb of his
long-worn heart stood still at the vision of
his victim, and his soul took flight to
realms that have no gold and no chronometer.</p>

<h2><a id="CROCKERS"></a>CROCKER’S HOLE.</h2>

<h3><a id="PART_I"></a>PART I.</h3>

<p>The Culm, which rises in Somersetshire,
and hastening into a fairer land (as the border
waters wisely do) falls into the Exe
near Killerton, formerly was a lovely trout
stream, such as perverts the Devonshire
angler from due respect toward Father
Thames and the other canals round London.
In the Devonshire valleys it is sweet
to see how soon a spring becomes a rill,
and a rill runs on into a rivulet, and a rivulet
swells into a brook; and before one has
time to say, “What are you at?”&mdash;before
the first tree it ever spoke to is a dummy,
or the first hill it ever ran down has turned
blue, here we have all the airs and graces,
demands and assertions of a full-grown
river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
But what is the test of a river? Who
shall say? “The power to drown a man,”
replies the river darkly. But rudeness is
not argument. Rather shall we say that
the power to work a good undershot wheel,
without being dammed up all night in a
pond, and leaving a tidy back-stream to
spare at the bottom of the orchard, is a
fair certificate of riverhood. If so, many
Devonshire streams attain that rank within
five miles of their spring; aye, and rapidly
add to it. At every turn they gather aid,
from ash-clad dingle and aldered meadow,
mossy rock and ferny wall, hedge-trough
roofed with bramble netting, where the baby
water lurks, and lanes that coming down to
ford bring suicidal tribute. Arrogant, all-engrossing
river, now it has claimed a great
valley of its own; and whatever falls within
the hill scoop, sooner or later belongs to
itself. Even the crystal “shutt” that
crosses the farmyard by the woodrick, and
glides down an aqueduct of last year’s bark
for Mary to fill the kettle from; and even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
the tricklets that have no organs for telling
or knowing their business, but only get
into unwary oozings in and among the
water-grass, and there make moss and forget
themselves among it&mdash;one and all, they
come to the same thing at last, and that is
the river.</p>

<p>The Culm used to be a good river at
Culmstock, tormented already by a factory,
but not strangled as yet by a railroad.
How it is now the present writer does not
know, and is afraid to ask, having heard of
a vile “Culm Valley Line.” But Culmstock
bridge was a very pretty place to stand
and contemplate the ways of trout; which
is easier work than to catch them. When I
was just big enough to peep above the rim,
or to lie upon it with one leg inside for fear
of tumbling over, what a mighty river it
used to seem, for it takes a treat there and
spreads itself. Above the bridge the factory
stream falls in again, having done its
business, and washing its hands in the innocent
half that has strayed down the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
meadows. Then under the arches they
both rejoice and come to a slide of about
two feet, and make a short, wide pool below,
and indulge themselves in perhaps two
islands, through which a little river always
magnifies itself, and maintains a mysterious
middle. But after that, all of it used to
come together, and make off in one body
for the meadows, intent upon nurturing
trout with rapid stickles, and buttercuppy
corners where fat flies may tumble in. And
here you may find in the very first meadow,
or at any rate you might have found, forty
years ago, the celebrated “Crocker’s
Hole.”</p>

<p>The story of Crocker is unknown to me,
and interesting as it doubtless was, I do
not deal with him, but with his Hole.
Tradition said that he was a baker’s boy
who, during his basket-rounds, fell in love
with a maiden who received the cottage-loaf,
or perhaps good “Households,” for
her master’s use. No doubt she was charming,
as a girl should be, but whether she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
encouraged the youthful baker and then
betrayed him with false <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i>, or whether
she “consisted” throughout,&mdash;as our
cousins across the water express it,&mdash;is
known to their <em>manes</em> only. Enough that
she would not have the floury lad; and that
he, after giving in his books and money,
sought an untimely grave among the trout.
And this was the first pool below the bread-walk
deep enough to drown a five-foot
baker boy. Sad it was; but such things
must be, and bread must still be delivered
daily.</p>

<p>A truce to such reflections,&mdash;as our
foremost writers always say, when they do
not see how to go on with them,&mdash;but it is a
serious thing to know what Crocker’s Hole
was like; because at a time when (if he
had only persevered, and married the maid,
and succeeded to the oven, and reared a
large family of short-weight bakers) he
might have been leaning on his crutch
beside the pool, and teaching his grandson
to swim by precept (that beautiful proxy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
for practice)&mdash;at such a time, I say, there
lived a remarkably fine trout in that hole.
Anglers are notoriously truthful, especially
as to what they catch, or even more frequently
have not caught. Though I may
have written fiction, among many other sins,&mdash;as
a nice old lady told me once,&mdash;now I
have to deal with facts; and foul scorn
would I count it ever to make believe that
I caught that fish. My length at that time
was not more than the butt of a four-jointed
rod, and all I could catch was a
minnow with a pin, which our cook Lydia
would not cook, but used to say, “Oh,
what a shame, Master Richard! they would
have been trout in the summer, please
God! if you would only a’ let ’em grow
on.” She is living now, and will bear me
out in this.</p>

<p>But upon every great occasion there arises
a great man; or to put it more accurately,
in the present instance, a mighty and distinguished
boy. My father, being the parson
of the parish, and getting, need it be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
said, small pay, took sundry pupils, very
pleasant fellows, about to adorn the universities.
Among them was the original
“Bude Light,” as he was satirically called
at Cambridge, for he came from Bude, and
there was no light in him. Among them
also was John Pike, a born Zebedee, if ever
there was one.</p>

<p>John Pike was a thick-set younker, with
a large and bushy head, keen blue eyes that
could see through water, and the proper
slouch of shoulder into which great anglers
ripen; but greater still are born with it; and
of these was Master John. It mattered little
what the weather was, and scarcely more
as to the time of year, John Pike must have
his fishing every day, and on Sundays he
read about it, and made flies. All the rest
of the time he was thinking about it.</p>

<p>My father was coaching him in the fourth
book of the Æneid and all those wonderful
speeches of Dido, where passion disdains
construction; but the only line Pike cared
for was of horsehair. “I fear, Mr. Pike,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
that you are not giving me your entire attention,”
my father used to say in his mild
dry way; and once when Pike was more
than usually abroad, his tutor begged to
share his meditations. “Well, sir,” said
Pike, who was very truthful, “I can see a
green drake by the strawberry tree, the first
of the season, and your derivation of ‘barbarous’
put me in mind of my barberry
dye.” In those days it was a very nice
point to get the right tint for the mallard’s
feather.</p>

<p>No sooner was lesson done than Pike,
whose rod was ready upon the lawn, dashed
away always for the river, rushing headlong
down the hill, and away to the left through
a private yard, where “no thoroughfare”
was put up, and a big dog stationed to enforce
it. But Cerberus himself could not
have stopped John Pike; his conscience
backed him up in trespass the most sinful
when his heart was inditing of a trout upon
the rise.</p>

<p>All this, however, is preliminary, as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
boy said when he put his father’s coat upon
his grandfather’s tenterhooks, with felonious
intent upon his grandmother’s apples; the
main point to be understood is this, that
nothing&mdash;neither brazen tower, hundred-eyed
Argus, nor Cretan Minotaur&mdash;could
stop John Pike from getting at a good
stickle. But, even as the world knows
nothing of its greatest men, its greatest men
know nothing of the world beneath their
very nose, till fortune sneezes dexter. For
two years John Pike must have been whipping
the water as hard as Xerxes, without
having ever once dreamed of the glorious
trout that lived in Crocker’s Hole. But
why, when he ought to have been at least
on bowing terms with every fish as long as
his middle finger, why had he failed to know
this champion? The answer is simple&mdash;because
of his short cuts. Flying as he did
like an arrow from a bow, Pike used to hit
his beloved river at an elbow, some furlong
below Crocker’s Hole, where a sweet little
stickle sailed away down stream, whereas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
for the length of a meadow upward the
water lay smooth, clear, and shallow;
therefore the youth, with so little time to
spare, rushed into the downward joy.</p>

<p>And here it may be noted that the leading
maxim of the present period, that man
can discharge his duty only by going counter
to the stream, was scarcely mooted in those
days. My grandfather (who was a wonderful
man, if he was accustomed to fill a cart
in two days of fly-fishing on the Barle)
regularly fished down stream; and what
more than a cartload need anyone put into
his basket?</p>

<p>And surely it is more genial and pleasant
to behold our friend the river growing and
thriving as we go on, strengthening its
voice and enlargening its bosom, and sparkling
through each successive meadow with
richer plenitude of silver, than to trace it
against its own grain and good-will toward
weakness, and littleness, and immature conceptions.</p>

<p>However, you will say that if John Pike<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
had fished up stream, he would have found
this trout much sooner. And that is true;
but still, as it was, the trout had more time
to grow into such a prize. And the way in
which John found him out was this. For
some days he had been tormented with a
very painful tooth, which even poisoned all
the joys of fishing. Therefore he resolved
to have it out, and sturdily entered the
shop of John Sweetland, the village blacksmith,
and there paid his sixpence. Sweetland
extracted the teeth of the village,
whenever they required it, in the simplest
and most effectual way. A piece of fine
wire was fastened round the tooth, and the
other end round the anvil’s nose, then the
sturdy blacksmith shut the lower half of his
shop door, which was about breast-high,
with the patient outside and the anvil within;
a strong push of the foot upset the anvil,
and the tooth flew out like a well-thrown fly.</p>

<p>When John Pike had suffered this very
bravely, “Ah, Master Pike,” said the
blacksmith, with a grin, “I reckon you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
won’t pull out thic there big vish,”&mdash;the
smithy commanded a view of the river,&mdash;“clever
as you be, quite so peart as
thiccy.”</p>

<p>“What big fish?” asked the boy, with
deepest interest, though his mouth was
bleeding fearfully.</p>

<p>“Why that girt mortial of a vish as hath
his hover in Crocker’s Hole. Zum on ’em
saith as a’ must be a zammon.”</p>

<p>Off went Pike with his handkerchief to
his mouth, and after him ran Alec Bolt, one
of his fellow-pupils, who had come to the
shop to enjoy the extraction.</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” was all that Pike could utter,
when by craftily posting himself he had
obtained a good view of this grand fish.</p>

<p>“I’ll lay you a crown you don’t catch
him!” cried Bolt, an impatient youth, who
scorned angling.</p>

<p>“How long will you give me?” asked the
wary Pike, who never made rash wagers.</p>

<p>“Oh! till the holidays if you like; or, if
that won’t do, till Michaelmas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
Now the midsummer holidays were six
weeks off&mdash;boys used not to talk of “vacations”
then, still less of “recesses.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll bet you,” said Pike, in his
slow way, bending forward carefully, with
his keen eyes on this monster; “but it
would not be fair to take till Michaelmas.
I’ll bet you a crown that I catch him before
the holidays&mdash;at least, unless some other
fellow does.”</p>

<p>The day of that most momentous interview
must have been the 14th of May. Of
the year I will not be so sure; for children
take more note of days than of years, for
which the latter have their full revenge
thereafter. It must have been the 14th,
because the morrow was our holiday, given
upon the 15th of May, in honour of a birthday.</p>

<p>Now, John Pike was beyond his years
wary as well as enterprising, calm as well
as ardent, quite as rich in patience as in
promptitude and vigour. But Alec Bolt was
a headlong youth, volatile, hot, and hasty,
fit only to fish the Maëlstrom, or a torrent
of new lava. And the moment he had laid
that wager he expected his crown piece;
though time, as the lawyers phrase it, was
“expressly of the essence of the contract.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
And now he demanded that Pike should
spend the holiday in trying to catch that
trout.</p>

<p>“I shall not go near him,” that lad
replied, “until I have got a new collar.”
No piece of personal adornment was it,
without which he would not act, but rather
that which now is called the fly-cast, or the
gut-cast, or the trace, or what it may be.
“And another thing,” continued Pike;
“the bet is off if you go near him, either
now or at any other time, without asking
my leave first, and then only going as I tell
you.”</p>

<p>“What do I want with the great slimy
beggar?” the arrogant Bolt made answer.
“A good rat is worth fifty of him. No
fear of my going near him, Pike. You
shan’t get out of it that way.”</p>

<p>Pike showed his remarkable qualities that
day, by fishing exactly as he would have fished
without having heard of the great Crockerite.
He was up and away upon the mill-stream
before breakfast; and the forenoon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
he devoted to his favourite course&mdash;first
down the Craddock stream, a very pretty
confluent of the Culm, and from its junction,
down the pleasant hams, where the
river winds toward Uffculme. It was my
privilege to accompany this hero, as his
humble Sancho; while Bolt and the faster
race went up the river ratting. We were
back in time to have Pike’s trout (which
ranged between two ounces and one-half
pound) fried for the early dinner; and here
it may be lawful to remark that the trout of
the Culm are of the very purest excellence,
by reason of the flinty bottom, at any rate
in these the upper regions. For the valley
is the western outlet of the Black-down
range, with the Beacon hill upon the north,
and Hackpen long ridge to the south; and
beyond that again the Whetstone hill, upon
whose western end dark port-holes scarped
with white grit mark the pits. But flint is
the staple of the broad Culm Valley, under
good, well-pastured loam; and here are
chalcedonies and agate stones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
At dinner everybody had a brace of
trout&mdash;large for the larger folk, little for
the little ones, with coughing and some
patting on the back for bones. What of
equal purport could the fierce rat-hunter
show? Pike explained many points in the
history of each fish, seeming to know them
none the worse, and love them all the
better, for being fried. We banqueted,
neither a whit did soul get stinted of
banquet impartial. Then the wielder of
the magic rod very modestly sought leave
of absence at the tea time.</p>

<p>“Fishing again, Mr. Pike, I suppose,”
my father answered pleasantly; “I used to
be fond of it at your age; but never so
entirely wrapped up in it as you are.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I am not going fishing again.
I want to walk to Wellington, to get some
things at Cherry’s.”</p>

<p>“Books, Mr. Pike? Ah! I am very
glad of that. But I fear it can only be
fly-books.”</p>

<p>“I want a little Horace for eighteen-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>pence&mdash;the
Cambridge one just published,
to carry in my pocket&mdash;and a new hank of
gut.”</p>

<p>“Which of the two is more important?
Put that into Latin, and answer it.”</p>

<p>“Utrum pluris facio? Flaccum flocci.
Viscera magni.” With this vast effort Pike
turned as red as any trout spot.</p>

<p>“After that who could refuse you?” said
my father. “You always tell the truth,
my boy, in Latin or in English.”</p>

<p>Although it was a long walk, some fourteen
miles to Wellington and back, I got
permission to go with Pike; and as we
crossed the bridge and saw the tree that
overhung Crocker’s Hole, I begged him to
show me that mighty fish.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” he replied. “It would
bring the blackguards. If the blackguards
once find him out, it is all over with him.”</p>

<p>“The blackguards are all in factory now,
and I am sure they cannot see us from the
windows. They won’t be out till five
o’clock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
With the true liberality of young England,
which abides even now as large and
glorious as ever, we always called the free
and enlightened operatives of the period by
the courteous name above set down, and it
must be acknowledged that some of them
deserved it, although perhaps they poached
with less of science than their sons. But
the cowardly murder of fish by liming the
water was already prevalent.</p>

<p>Yielding to my request and perhaps his
own desire&mdash;manfully kept in check that
morning&mdash;Pike very carefully approached
that pool, commanding me to sit down
while he reconnoitred from the meadow
upon the right bank of the stream. And
the place which had so sadly quenched the
fire of the poor baker’s love filled my childish
heart with dread and deep wonder at
the cruelty of women. But as for John
Pike, all he thought of was the fish and the
best way to get at him.</p>

<p>Very likely that hole is “holed out”
now, as the Yankees well express it, or at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
any rate changed out of knowledge. Even
in my time a very heavy flood entirely
altered its character; but to the eager eye
of Pike it seemed pretty much as follows,
and possibly it may have come to such a
form again:</p>

<p>The river, after passing though a hurdle
fence at the head of the meadow, takes a
little turn or two of bright and shallow
indifference, then gathers itself into a good
strong slide, as if going down a slope
instead of steps. The right bank is high
and beetles over with yellow loam and
grassy fringe; but the other side is of flinty
shingle, low and bare and washed by floods.
At the end of this rapid, the stream turns
sharply under an ancient alder tree into a
large, deep, calm repose, cool, unruffled, and
sheltered from the sun by branch and
leaf&mdash;and that is the hole of poor Crocker.</p>

<p>At the head of the pool (where the hasty
current rushes in so eagerly, with noisy
excitement and much ado) the quieter
waters from below, having rested and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
enlarged themselves, come lapping up
round either curve, with some recollection
of their past career, the hoary experience
of foam. And sidling toward the new
arrival of the impulsive column, where they
meet it, things go on, which no man can
describe without his mouth being full of
water. A “V” is formed, a fancy letter V,
beyond any designer’s tracery, and even
beyond his imagination, a perpetually
fluctuating limpid wedge, perpetually
crenelled and rippled into by little ups and
downs that try to make an impress, but can
only glide away upon either side or sink in
dimples under it. And here a gray bough
of the ancient alder stretches across, like a
thirsty giant’s arm, and makes it a very
ticklish place to throw a fly. Yet this was
the very spot our John Pike must put his
fly into, or lose his crown.</p>

<p>Because the great tenant of Crocker’s
Hole, who allowed no other fish to wag a fin
there, and from strict monopoly had grown
so fat, kept his victualing yard&mdash;if so low<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
an expression can be used concerning him&mdash;within
about a square yard of this spot.
He had a sweet hover, both for rest and
recreation, under the bank, in a placid antre,
where the water made no noise, but tickled
his belly in digestive ease. The loftier the
character is of any being, the slower and
more dignified his movements are. No true
psychologist could have believed&mdash;as Sweetland
the blacksmith did, and Mr. Pook the
tinman&mdash;that this trout could ever be the
embodiment of Crocker. For this was the
last trout in the universal world to drown
himself for love; if truly any trout has
done so.</p>

<p>“You may come now, and try to look
along my back,” John Pike, with a reverential
whisper, said to me. “Now don’t be
in a hurry, young stupid; kneel down. He
is not to be disturbed at his dinner, mind.
You keep behind me, and look along my
back; I never clapped eyes on such a
whopper.”</p>

<p>I had to kneel down in a tender reminiscence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
of pasture land, and gaze carefully;
and not having eyes like those of our
Zebedee (who offered his spine for a
camera, as he crawled on all fours in front
of me), it took me a long time to descry an
object most distinct to all who have that
special gift of piercing with their eyes the
water. See what is said upon this subject
in that delicious book, “The Gamekeeper
at Home.”</p>

<p>“You are no better than a muff,” said
Pike, and it was not in my power to deny it.</p>

<p>“If the sun would only leave off,” I said.
But the sun, who was having a very pleasant
play with the sparkle of the water and
the twinkle of the leaves, had no inclination
to leave off yet, but kept the rippling
crystal in a dance of flashing facets, and
the quivering verdure in a steady flush of
gold.</p>

<p>But suddenly a May-fly, a luscious gray-drake,
richer and more delicate than canvas-back
or woodcock, with a dart and a
leap and a merry zigzag, began to enjoy a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
little game above the stream. Rising and
falling like a gnat, thrilling her gauzy wings,
and arching her elegant pellucid frame,
every now and then she almost dipped her
three long tapering whisks into the dimples
of the water.</p>

<p>“He sees her! He’ll have her as sure as
a gun!” cried Pike, with a gulp, as if he
himself were “rising.” “Now, can you
see him, stupid?”</p>

<p>“Crikey, crokums!” I exclaimed, with
classic elegance; “I have seen that long
thing for five minutes; but I took it for
a tree.”</p>

<p>“You little”&mdash;animal quite early in the
alphabet&mdash;“now don’t you stir a peg, or
I’ll dig my elbow into you.”</p>

<p>The great trout was stationary almost as
a stone, in the middle of the “V” above
described. He was gently fanning with his
large clear fins, but holding his own against
the current mainly by the wagging of his
broad-fluked tail. As soon as my slow
eyes had once defined him, he grew upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
them mightily, moulding himself in the
matrix of the water, as a thing put into
jelly does. And I doubt whether even
John Pike saw him more accurately than
I did. His size was such, or seemed to be
such, that I fear to say a word about it;
not because language does not contain the
word, but from dread of exaggeration.
But his shape and colour may be reasonably
told without wounding the feeling of an
age whose incredulity springs from self-knowledge.</p>

<p>His head was truly small, his shoulders
vast; the spring of his back was like a rainbow
when the sun is southing; the generous
sweep of his deep elastic belly, nobly
pulped out with rich nurture, showed what
the power of his brain must be, and seemed
to undulate, time for time, with the vibrant
vigilance of his large wise eyes. His latter
end was consistent also. An elegant taper
run of counter, coming almost to a cylinder,
as a mackered does, boldly developed with
a hugeous spread to a glorious amplitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
of swallow-tail. His colour was all that
can well be desired, but ill-described by
any poor word-palette. Enough that he
seemed to tone away from olive and umber,
with carmine stars, to glowing gold and
soft pure silver, mantled with a subtle flush
of rose and fawn and opal.</p>

<p>Swoop came a swallow, as we gazed, and
was gone with a flick, having missed the
May-fly. But the wind of his passage, or
the skir of wing, struck the merry dancer
down, so that he fluttered for one instant
on the wave, and that instant was enough.
Swift as the swallow, and more true of aim,
the great trout made one dart, and a sound,
deeper than a tinkle, but as silvery as a
bell, rang the poor ephemerid’s knell. The
rapid water scarcely showed a break; but a
bubble sailed down the pool, and the dark
hollow echoed with the music of a rise.</p>

<p>“He knows how to take a fly,” said
Pike; “he has had too many to be tricked
with mine. Have him I must; but how
ever shall I do it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
All the way to Wellington he uttered not
a word, but shambled along with a mind
full of care. When I ventured to look up
now and then, to surmise what was going
on beneath his hat, deeply-set eyes and a
wrinkled forehead, relieved at long intervals
by a solid shake, proved that there are
meditations deeper than those of philosopher
or statesman.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><a id="PART_III"></a>PART III.</h3>
</div>

<p>Surely no trout could have been misled
by the artificial May-fly of that time, unless
he were either a very young fish, quite new
to entomology, or else one afflicted with a
combination of myopy and bulimy. Even
now there is room for plenty of improvement
in our counterfeit presentment; but
in those days the body was made with yellow
mohair, ribbed with red silk and gold
twist, and as thick as a fertile bumble-bee.
John Pike perceived that to offer such a thing
to Crocker’s trout would probably consign
him&mdash;even if his great stamina should over-get
the horror&mdash;to an uneatable death,
through just and natural indignation. On
the other hand, while the May-fly lasted, a
trout so cultured, so highly refined, so full
of light and sweetness, would never demean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
himself to low bait, or any coarse son of a
maggot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Alec Bolt allowed poor Pike
no peaceful thought, no calm absorption of
high mind into the world of flies, no placid
period of cobblers’ wax, floss-silk, turned
hackles, and dubbing. For in making of
flies John Pike had his special moments of
inspiration, times of clearer insight into the
everlasting verities, times of brighter conception
and more subtle execution, tails of
more elastic grace and heads of a neater
and nattier expression. As a poet labours at
one immortal line, compressing worlds of
wisdom into the music of ten syllables, so
toiled the patient Pike about the fabric of a
fly comprising all the excellence that ever
sprang from maggot. Yet Bolt rejoiced to
jerk his elbow at the moment of sublimest
art. And a swarm of flies was blighted
thus.</p>

<p>Peaceful, therefore, and long-suffering,
and full of resignation as he was, John Pike
came slowly to the sad perception that arts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
avail not without arms. The elbow, so
often jerked, at last took a voluntary jerk
from the shoulder and Alec Bolt lay prostrate,
with his right eye full of cobbler’s
wax. This put a desirable check upon his
energies for a week or more, and by that
time Pike had flown his fly.</p>

<p>When the honeymoon of spring and summer
(which they are now too fashionable to
celebrate in this country), the hey-day of
the whole year marked by the budding of
the wild rose, the start of the wheatear
from its sheath, the feathering of the lesser
plantain, and flowering of the meadow-sweet,
and, foremost for the angler’s joy, the
caracole of May-flies&mdash;when these things
are to be seen and felt (which has not
happened at all this year), then rivers
should be mild and bright, skies blue and
white with fleecy cloud, the west wind
blowing softly, and the trout in charming
appetite.</p>

<p>On such a day came Pike to the bank of
Culm, with a loudly beating heart. A fly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
there is, not ignominious, or of cowdab
origin, neither gross and heavy-bodied,
from cradlehood of slimy stones, nor yet of
menacing aspect and suggesting deeds of
poison, but elegant, bland, and of sunny
nature, and obviously good to eat. Him
or her&mdash;why quest we which?&mdash;the shepherd
of the dale, contemptuous of gender,
except in his own species, has called, and
as long as they two coexist will call, the
“Yellow Sally.” A fly that does not waste
the day in giddy dances and the fervid
waltz, but undergoes family incidents with
decorum and discretion. He or she, as the
case may be,&mdash;for the natural history of the
river bank is a book to come hereafter, and
of fifty men who make flies not one knows
the name of the fly he is making,&mdash;in the
early morning of June, or else in the
second quarter of the afternoon, this Yellow
Sally fares abroad, with a nice well-ordered
flutter.</p>

<p>Despairing of the May-fly, as it still may
be despaired of, Pike came down to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
river with his master-piece of portraiture.
The artificial Yellow Sally is generally
always&mdash;as they say in Cheshire&mdash;a mile or
more too yellow. On the other hand, the
“Yellow Dun” conveys no idea of any
Sally. But Pike had made a very decent
Sally, not perfect (for he was young as well
as wise), but far above any counterfeit to
be had in fishing-tackle shops. How he
made it, he told nobody. But if he lives
now, as I hope he does, any of my readers
may ask him through the G.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;O., and
hope to get an answer.</p>

<p>It fluttered beautifully on the breeze, and
in such living form, that a brother or sister
Sally came up to see it, and went away
sadder and wiser. Then Pike said: “Get
away, you young wretch,” to your humble
servant who tells this tale; yet being better
than his words, allowed that pious follower
to lie down upon his digestive organs and
with deep attention watch. There must
have been great things to see, but to see
them so was difficult. And if I huddle up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
what happened, excitement also shares the
blame.</p>

<p>Pike had fashioned well the time and
manner of this overture. He knew that
the giant Crockerite was satiate now with
May-flies, or began to find their flavour failing,
as happens to us with asparagus, marrow-fat
peas, or strawberries, when we have
had a month of them. And he thought
that the first Yellow Sally of the season,
inferior though it were, might have the
special charm of novelty. With the skill of
a Zulu, he stole up through the branches
over the lower pool till he came to a spot
where a yard-wide opening gave just space
for spring of rod. Then he saw his desirable
friend at dinner, wagging his tail, as a
hungry gentleman dining with the Lord
Mayor agitates his coat. With one dexterous
whirl, untaught by any of the many
books upon the subject, John Pike laid his
Yellow Sally (for he cast with one fly only)
as lightly as gossamer upon the rapid, about
a yard in front of the big trout’s head. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
moment’s pause, and then, too quick for
words, was the things that happened.</p>

<p>A heavy plunge was followed by a fearful
rush. Forgetful of current the river was
ridged, as if with a plough driven under it;
the strong line, though given out as fast as
might be, twanged like a harp-string as it
cut the wave, and then Pike stood up, like a
ship dismasted, with the butt of his rod
snapped below the ferrule. He had one of
those foolish things, just invented, a hollow
butt of hickory; and the finial ring of his
spare top looked out, to ask what had happened
to the rest of it. “Bad luck!”
cried the fisherman; “but never mind, I
shall have him next time, to a certainty.”</p>

<p>When this great issue came to be considered,
the cause of it was sadly obvious.
The fish, being hooked, had made off with
the rush of a shark for the bottom of the
pool. A thicket of saplings below the alder
tree had stopped the judicious hooker from
all possibility of following; and when he
strove to turn him by elastic pliance, his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
rod broke at the breach of pliability. “I
have learned a sad lesson,” said John Pike,
looking sadly.</p>

<p>How many fellows would have given up
this matter, and glorified themselves for
having hooked so grand a fish, while explaining
that they must have caught him, if
they could have done it! But Pike only
told me not to say a word about it, and
began to make ready for another tug of
war. He made himself a splice-rod, short
and handy, of well-seasoned ash, with a
stout top of bamboo, tapered so discreetly,
and so balanced in its spring, that verily it
formed an arc, with any pressure on it, as
perfect as a leafy poplar in a stormy summer.
“Now break it if you can,” he said,
“by any amount of rushes; I’ll hook you
by your jacket collar; you cut away now,
and I’ll land you.”</p>

<p>This was highly skilful, and he did it
many times; and whenever I was landed
well, I got a lollypop, so that I was careful
not to break his tackle. Moreover he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
made him a landing net, with a kidney-bean
stick, a ring of wire, and his own best
nightcap of strong cotton net. Then he
got the farmer’s leave, and lopped obnoxious
bushes; and now the chiefest question
was: what bait, and when to offer it? In
spite of his sad rebuff, the spirit of John
Pike had been equable. The genuine
angling mind is steadfast, large, and self-supported,
and to the vapid, ignominious
chaff, tossed by swine upon the idle wind,
it pays as much heed as a big trout does
to a dance of midges. People put their
fingers to their noses and said: “Master
Pike, have you caught him yet?” and Pike
only answered: “Wait a bit.” If ever
this fortitude and perseverance is to be
recovered as the English Brand (the one
thing that has made us what we are, and
may yet redeem us from niddering shame),
a degenerate age should encourage the
habit of fishing and never despairing. And
the brightest sign yet for our future is the
increasing demand for hooks and gut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
Pike fished in a manlier age, when
nobody would dream of cowering from a
savage because he was clever at skulking;
and when, if a big fish broke the rod, a
stronger rod was made for him, according
to the usage of Great Britain. And though
the young angler had been defeated, he did
not sit down and have a good cry over it.</p>

<p>About the second week in June, when
the May-fly had danced its day, and died,&mdash;for
the season was an early one,&mdash;and
Crocker’s trout had recovered from the
wound to his feelings and philanthropy,
there came a night of gentle rain, of
pleasant tinkling upon window ledges, and
a soothing patter among young leaves, and
the Culm was yellow in the morning. “I
mean to do it this afternoon,” Pike
whispered to me, as he came back panting.
“When the water clears there will be a
splendid time.”</p>

<p>The lover of the rose knows well a gay
voluptuous beetle, whose pleasure is to lie
embedded in a fount of beauty. Deep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
among the incurving petals of the blushing
fragrance, he loses himself in his joys
sometimes, till a breezy waft reveals him.
And when the sunlight breaks upon his
luscious dissipation, few would have the
heart to oust him, such a gem from such a
setting. All his back is emerald sparkles;
all his front red Indian gold, and here and
there he grows white spots to save the eye
from aching. Pike put his finger in and
fetched him out, and offered him a little
change of joys, by putting a Limerick hook
through his thorax, and bringing it out
between his elytra. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Cetonia aurata</i> liked it
not, but pawed the air very naturally, and
fluttered with his wings attractively.</p>

<p>“I meant to have tried with a fern-web”,
said the angler; “until I saw one of these
beggars this morning. If he works like
that upon the water, he will do. It was
hopeless to try artificials again. What a
lovely colour the water is! Only three days
now to the holidays. I have run it very
close. You be ready, younker.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
With these words he stepped upon a
branch of the alder, for the tone of the
waters allowed approach, being soft
and sublustrous, without any mud. Also
Master Pike’s own tone was such as becomes
the fisherman, calm, deliberate, free
from nerve, but full of eye and muscle.
He stepped upon the alder bough to get as
near as might be to the fish, for he could
not cast this beetle like a fly; it must be
dropped gently and allowed to play. “You
may come and look,” he said to me; “when
the water is so, they have no eyes in their
tails.”</p>

<p>The rose-beetle trod upon the water
prettily, under a lively vibration, and he
looked quite as happy, and considerably
more active, than when he had been cradled
in the anthers of the rose. To the eye of
a fish he was a strong individual, fighting
courageously with the current, but sure to
be beaten through lack of fins; and mercy
suggested, as well as appetite, that the
proper solution was to gulp him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
“Hooked him in the gullet. He can’t
get off!” cried John Pike, labouring to keep
his nerves under; “every inch of tackle is
as strong as a bell-pull. Now, if I don’t
land him, I will never fish again!”</p>

<p>Providence, which had constructed Pike,
foremost of all things, for lofty angling&mdash;disdainful
of worm and even minnow&mdash;Providence,
I say, at this adjuration, pronounced
that Pike must catch that trout.
Not many anglers are heaven-born; and
for one to drop off the hook halfway
through his teens would be infinitely worse
than to slay the champion trout. Pike felt
the force of this, and rushing through the
rushes, shouted: “I am sure to have him,
Dick! Be ready with my nightcap.”</p>

<p>Rod in a bow, like a springle-riser; line
on the hum, like the string of Paganini;
winch on the gallop, like a harpoon wheel,
Pike, the head-centre of everything, dashing
through thick and thin, and once
taken overhead&mdash;for he jumped into the
hole, when he must have lost him else, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
the fish too impetuously towed him out,
and made off in passion for another pool,
when, if he had only retired to his hover,
the angler might have shared the baker’s
fate&mdash;all these things (I tell you, for they
all come up again, as if the day were yesterday)
so scared me of my never very steadfast
wits, that I could only holloa! But
one thing I did, I kept the nightcap ready.</p>

<p>“He is pretty nearly spent, I do believe,”
said Pike; and his voice was like balm of
Gilead, as we came to Farmer Anning’s
meadow, a quarter of a mile below Crocker’s
Hole. “Take it coolly, my dear boy, and
we shall be safe to have him.”</p>

<p>Never have I felt, through forty years,
such tremendous responsibility. I had not
the faintest notion how to use a landing
net; but a mighty general directed me.
“Don’t let him see it; don’t let him see it!
Don’t clap it over him; go under him, you
stupid! If he makes another rush, he will
get off, after all. Bring it up his tail.
Well done! You have him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
The mighty trout lay in the nightcap of
Pike, which was half a fathom long, with a
tassel at the end, for his mother had made
it in the winter evenings. “Come and hold
the rod, if you can’t lift him,” my master
shouted, and so I did. Then, with both
arms straining, and his mouth wide open,
John Pike made a mighty sweep, and we
both fell upon the grass and rolled, with
the giant of the deep flapping heavily
between us, and no power left to us, except
to cry, “Hurrah!”</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
